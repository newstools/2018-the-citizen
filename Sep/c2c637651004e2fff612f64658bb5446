South African Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner Mark Kingon’s term has been extended by Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene for a further 90 days effective from September 14.
In a statement, Nene said: “Section 7 of the Sars act empowers the minister of finance to appoint an acting commissioner. The president, however, appoints a permanent commissioner.”
Kingon was appointed as acting commissioner following the suspension of Tom Moyane.

President Cyril Ramaphosa suspended Moyane earlier this year after the president had requested him to resign.
A commission of inquiry into Sars was subsequently established.
Moyane was linked to approving questionable VAT refunds worth as much as R70 million paid to the Guptas’ Oakbay Investments, allegedly via a third-party company, which is illegal. He also shielded his second in charge, Jonas Makwakwa, from allegations that Makwakwa had received money from a company that was appointed as a debt collector for Sars.
