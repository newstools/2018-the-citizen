Provincial community safety spokesperson Ofentse Morwane said: “Preliminary reports indicate that the boy stole his father’s VW Golf GTI and used it without permission. Upon noticing the high-speeding car, the officers activated blue lights and sirens and tried to stop the car.”
When the youngster and his passenger allegedly tried to make a run for it, he collided with a barrier near a construction site. He was taken to the Erasmia Police Station and his father was called.


He faces charges of reckless and negligent driving, exceeding the speed limit, driving without a licence and defeating the ends of justice.
