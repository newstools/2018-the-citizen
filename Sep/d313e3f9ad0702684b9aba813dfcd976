The Tshwane east police cluster has opened a victim-friendly family violence, child protection, and sexual offences office in Waltloo near Silverton, reports Pretoria East Rekord.
Cluster commander General Andre Wiese said the facility would go a long way in dealing with crime affecting children, older persons, and domestic violence in the area.

“The facility boasts state-of-the-art technology to be used by forensic social workers in the compilation of expert evidence to help the conviction of criminals,” said Wiese.
He said during the opening on Tuesday that the Domestic Violence Act was a true milestone for the democratic government.
“Hopefully, the new facility would serve as a message to perpetrators of crimes against children that their time is over,” he said.
He thanked Liezel van Staden, project manager of Matla a bana (children’s power), for being instrumental in spearheading the project to set up the office, as well as Absa bank and others who made the facility possible.
