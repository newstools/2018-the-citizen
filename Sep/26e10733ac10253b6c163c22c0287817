On a day when a few favourites look good at Durbanville on to-day, the standout of standouts is Trippi’s Express in Race 1.
He was a clear second to subsequent Listed Sophomore Sprint winner Pleasedtomeetyou on debut, and the third and fourth finishers there have both won their next starts easily.
He looks a five-star bet, despite being drawn widest of the eight runners.
Also leaping off the page is Crown Towers in Race 7.
This Australian import was heavily supported on debut over a sprint trip, and looked rather special as he cruised clear of what appeared a decent maiden line up.
He wasn’t unduly punished by the handicappers with a mark of 85, and from the inside draw can be expected to follow up comfortably over a more suitable 1400m.
This could well close off another good day for the Justin Snaith-Richard Fourie combination, as in Race 2 the extremely well-bred Juniper Spring has been costly to follow, but really does appear hard to oppose on this occasion.
Strongest race of the day is Race 6, a Pinnacle Stakes over 1000m.
Best in on paper is top weight La Favourari, but this six-year-old gelding appears to have his problems, and has only appeared twice since last October.
He did show some signs of life when only fading late upon his latest return a month ago, and at best is a serious contender.
