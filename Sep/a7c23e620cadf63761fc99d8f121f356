“With the high number of accidents on the roads, we wanted to ensure that the maidens travel in buses that are in good condition and that they will arrive in Nongoma and return home safely,” Sibiya said.
She assured parents that all the buses are in good order after a full inspection was conducted.
KZN MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Mxolisi Kaunda said law enforcement operations will also be deployed on all the roads.
