Come the end of October, Gavin Davis will no longer be a senior DA MP as he will be stepping down in favour of a new position in the private sector as CEO at Resolve Communications.
According to Business Day, Resolve Communications is a Cape Town-based public relations firm headed by former DA leader Tony Leon.
Speaking to the publication, Davis said: “I have decided to accept a position as the CEO at Resolve Communications in Cape Town. This is a very exciting opportunity to lead a unique strategic communications business into its next phase of growth. I am proud to have been involved in the DA as a communications professional and as an MP. The project of building a prosperous and nonracial SA will remain close to my heart.”
Davis was once the DA’s policy chief and director of communications, and has served in various portfolio committees including communications, basic education, and energy in parliament since 2014.
