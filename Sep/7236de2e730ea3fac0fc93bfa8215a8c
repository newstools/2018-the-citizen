Deputy minister of justice and constitutional development, John Jeffrey, has taken to Twitter to debunk a video that he says is circulating on social media, claiming to show white South Africans getting ready to defend themselves from land expropriation.
According to Jeffrey, you can tell it’s false because the “steering wheels” of the cars are on the wrong side. While South African steering wheels are found on the right, those in the video can be seen on the left.
The video, that is being shared on social media, mainly among right wing and far-right accounts in the US, appears to show several clips of white people shooting semi-automatic and automatic weapons seemingly randomly spliced together, does not come across as at all credible.


Some on the right and far right in places including the US, the UK and Australia have embraced the cause of white people fighting land expropriation without compensations.
It was reported in April that people in Australia marched against “genocide” against white people in SA.

The tweet appears to have been inspired by reports by conservative Fox News journalist Tucker Carlson.

“I believe our trip played a role,” he said, referring to a recent lobbying excursion to the US he’d undertaken with Kallie Kriel, the organisation’s CEO.
