The bacteria, called necrotising enterocolitis, is reported to affect the intestine of prematurely born infants, leading to infection. Children’s Hospital Los Angeles explains the disease invades the wall of the intestine, which causes local infection and inflammation that can ultimately destroy the wall of the bowel.
Of the 43 cases the hospital faced between March and July, nine were fatal, reports EWN.
How the outbreak of the infectious disease was contracted by the babies is not yet known. The outbreak was said to have ended in July, reports News24.
