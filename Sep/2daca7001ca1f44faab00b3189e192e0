While the initial task and goals of the Brics countries were more about the economy and coordination of the efforts to get better results to strengthen dialogue, there was a need for the Brics nations to have a greater influence in global financial and economic affairs.
This is according to the Russian Ambassador to South Africa Mikhail Petrakov who delivered an address on Brics and Russia’s bilateral relations with South Africa at an event held at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA) in Cape Town on Wednesday evening.
“Of course, we want all the Brics countries to have better conditions for the development of our national economies and reasoning standards of our citizens, and also, we want our countries to have more weight in international and global financial and economic currency, and we want improvement of global economic architecture,” said Petrakov.
Brics is made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
