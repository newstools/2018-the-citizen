Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor, known for being one of the primary whistleblowers on alleged Gupta state capture, had social media’s eyebrows raised on Saturday.
She wrote: “I am very angry! My heart is pulpitating [sic] badly!”
Mentor said she had received a “screen-grap” of a conversation that was allegedly “(and appears to be) of a Cabinet Minister with a 16-year-old wherein he sent the girl his [artificially] enlarged penis”.
She claimed the supposed conversation occurred in 2017.
“It’s reported the parents did the screen-grap [sic] from their daughter and then confiscated her phone. The poor child was reportedly infected…”
The post left people on Twitter such as the anonymous “king of black Twitter” @AdvBarryRoux, confused.




Others were not convinced by Mentor.




On her post, Mentor’s followers asked her to share the screen-grab, but nothing was forthcoming.
Earlier, she bizarrely blamed Facebook for her erratic spelling and grammar.

Her followers also took her to task for sharing a completely ridiculous news story about an airliner supposedly dumping a huge amount of human waste on to a cruise ship.

Her more loyal followers begged her to delete the post since they felt it damaged her credibility.
