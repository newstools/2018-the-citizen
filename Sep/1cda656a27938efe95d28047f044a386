Still, an inch is as good as a mile when it comes to records and all’s well that ends well.
Hundreds upon hundreds of people flocked to the fields to take part in the record, to be spectators and just to enjoy the carnival atmosphere with the family.
Eugene Zietsman, the man with the plan who made sure the braai world record now rests exactly where it belongs, thanked everyone for their support and for coming out to break the record.
The North Coast Courier’s Facebook Live of the event was watched by more than 24 000 people.
