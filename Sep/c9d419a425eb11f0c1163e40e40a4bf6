The city of Cape Town announced on Tuesday that dam levels had improved from 70 to 74% of storage capacity over the past week, following recent good rains.
According to the city, the average water consumption for the past week was up slightly from 505 million litres per day the previous week to 511 million litres per day.
The city urged residents to continue with water saving efforts over the next few months as the city monitors the water situation going into summer.
A statement from the city added: “Water restrictions and tariffs will be lowered from level six to level five from October due to the encouraging dam recovery and the ongoing conservation efforts by Capetonians.
“These reductions are premised on the expectation that water users will continue to use water sparingly so that overall usage remains in the current 500-million-litres-per-day bracket.”
Earlier this year, Cape Town faced the possibility of completely running out of water as the five main feeder dams into the metro were at dangerously low levels.
