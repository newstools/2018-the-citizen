According to Alexandra Police Station spokesperson Stephen Malatjie, the mothers of the deceased children are sisters and have allegedly been leaving these children alone at home on more than one occasion.

They found the body of a six-year-old child; the other three kids were severely burned and all later passed away in hospital. Only the 14-year-old who went to look for help survived the inferno.”
One mother who was found in a tavern by the police was charged with child negligence and taken into custody. The police are still looking for the other mother with regards to a similar case.
