The two farm workers accused of killing a teenage boy in Coligny were not credible witnesses, the North West High Court heard today.
“The accused were not credible and reliable witnesses. The version of the accused also indicated the following legal issues, in arresting the deceased the accused were involved in a civil arrest which place certain duties on them. One, to take care of the deceased by protecting him from harm, two to take precautionary measures against any harm to the deceased,” said prosecutor Rapula Molefe.
“Evidence before the honourable court clearly shows the accused created a dangerous situation which they failed to control.”
He was presenting closing arguments in the trial of Pieter Doorewaard, 27, and Phillip Schutte, 34, accused of killing Matlhomola Mosweu, 16, in Coligny on October 20, 2017.
Molefe argued that state witnesses were credible, emphasising that Brigadier Clifford Kgorane was a very impressive witness, as he accepted the poor and embarrassing investigation by the Coligny police.
The defence had argued that there was no credible evidence indicating Doorewaard and Schutte threatened or intimidated Mosweu.
The case was postponed to October 17 for judgement.
Mosweu’s death set off a violent community protests in Coligny that left six houses and three trucks torched, while several shops were looted and damaged.
Doorewaard and Schutte are out on a R5,000 bail each.
