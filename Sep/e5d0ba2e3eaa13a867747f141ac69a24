President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday the government had begun a review of various administered prices, starting with electricity, port, and rail tariffs in a bid to reduce the cost of doing business, boost exports, and make South African industries more competitive.
“Within the next few weeks, government will initiate the process for the allocation of high-demand radio spectrum to enable licensing,” Ramaphosa said during a news conference to unveil a new economic stimulus package.
“This will unlock significant value in the telecommunications sector, increase competition, promote investment, and reduce data costs. Lower data costs will also provide relief for poor households and increase the overall competitiveness of the South African economy.”
