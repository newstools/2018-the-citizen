Residents in Westbury and Newclare have barricaded roads following the death of a mother. The mother and her child were on their way home from Coronationville when they were caught in the crossfire of a gang shooting. The 45-year-old woman died on the scene and her child was rushed to the hospital.
This morning, the Saturation Unit of the JMPD cordoned off the main access to Commando and Price roads, diverting traffic away from the area to prevent commuter injuries.
