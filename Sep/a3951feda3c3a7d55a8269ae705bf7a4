President of the African People’s Convention (APC) and chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) Themba Godi has captured the attention of social media users for the most unexpected reason – his appreciation of beautiful women.
Godi, who is fairly active on social media, initially riled up other users when he weighed in on president Cyril Ramaphosa’s stimulus package and Thabo Mbeki’s criticism of the ANC’s approach to land expropriation.


A keen-eyed user then shared a screenshot of a notification he got about what Godi has been liking on social media.


This sparked a number of hilarious opinions on his penchant for “thirst traps.”






In response, another user pointed out that this is a common occurrence as a quick scroll through the ‘likes’ tab of Godi’s Twitter account reveals more saucy pictures liked by him.


Although he is very active and responsive on Twitter, he has chosen to ignore questions from his followers about the images.
