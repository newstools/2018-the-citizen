Despite a potentially disastrous fall at Scottsville on Sunday, Lyle Hewitson will be taking another step in his comeback from injury tomorrow at the Turffontein In-side track.
He confirmed he will be fit to ride when contacted yesterday and this will be his final local meeting before he departs for the inaugural Premier Gateway International Jockeys Challenge, presented by Phumelela Gaming & Leisure and TABCORP in Singa-pore on 25 September.
Tomorrow’s meeting was originally scheduled for the Vaal Classic track, but was moved on Mon-day due to problems with the turf.
And his regular boss Sean Tarry provides him with what appears the best bet on the card in the form of rapidly improving Jamra in Race 4, a FM 92 Handicap over 1800m.
She makes her Inside track debut, but this Trippi filly has won her last two outings in very easy fashion from the front, and this tight circuit generally favours those who race near the pace.
She also tries 2000m for the first time, but certainly hasn’t been weakening in the finish over 1600m.
If anything she should be even be er over this trip, and despite a rise in class will be extremely tough to peg back with a mere 53kg and the reigning champion jockey aboard. Being Fabulous and Tammany Hall seem most likely to give cheek among the sparse six runner party.
Zulu Dawn in Race 3 provides another solid-looking chance.
While no star, this Stuart Pettigrew-trained filly is a two-time winner who met a fair sort in Gimme Hope Johanna last time.
She did very well to get within 1.5 lengths.
She drops in class here, and has every chance of scoring a third career victory.
Piere Strydom provides a more than able deputy for indisposed usual jockey Marco van Rensburg.
