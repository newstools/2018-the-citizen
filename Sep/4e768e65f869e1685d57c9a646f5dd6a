The Sandton SPCA recently confiscated two sub-adult male leptailurus servals (wild cats) from a private residence in Bryanston, reports Fourways Review.
According to Nicci Wright, a wildlife rehabilitation specialist at Johannesburg Wildlife Veterinary Hospital in Glenferness, the servals were being kept illegally as pets.
She said: “We sedated them and both underwent a complete health check and we found that they were both in good health, although a little overweight.”

Wright explained that one of the servals has already been placed into a pre-release enclosure at his release site and the other will soon be placed at another reserve.
“Due to them being both males, they cannot be released into the same territory, as males are territorial which will make it more difficult if they are in the same vicinity.”
She explained that it is never a good idea or in the best interest of the wildlife animals to keep them as pets as they won’t be able to fulfil their natural behaviour.
“Wildlife that’s kept as pets usually don’t get to eat the right diet and tend to have behavioural issues hence it’s never a good idea to keep them as pets.”
Wright stated that the two males were doing well at the veterinary hospital.
The veterinary hospital treats indigenous animals free of charge, relying solely on the donations and support of the community.
