Twitter users immediately came up with the hashtag #RIPFreeTwitter, voicing their feelings about the change, as well as the hashtag #MyLastWordsToFreeTwitter which saw MTN subscribers flex their senses of humour.
Popular parody account @AdvBarryRoux was among those who weighed in.








According to MyBroadband, MTN said it had over 13 million Twitter users on its network in August 2018, with 1.9 petabytes of data being used on the network per month.
“Overall usage trends towards video and images have determined that it is no longer feasible to offer a service like Twitter for free due to the cost and demand it places on the network.”
This comes after the major cell-phone service provider recently placed a 500MB usage cap on its free Twitter offering, claiming that exploitation by hackers had pushed them to make the change.
