At around 12pm on Sunday, two suspects made an attempt to make away with what is believed to be stolen goods, reports the Roodepoort Northsider.
It is believed the suspects attempted to steal from the centre’s Woolworths outlet.
The two women, driving a Volkswagen Polo, broke through the boom gates at the mall’s exit, but also drove over the spikes, puncturing their tyres.
