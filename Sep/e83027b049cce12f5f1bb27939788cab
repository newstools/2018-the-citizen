Hasa also welcomed Ramaphosa’s view that the summit should result in practical and implementable initiatives that delivered jobs for South Africans.
“We urge all South Africans to respond to the president’s challenge to find ways to move our economy forward into growth collaboratively, and we are supportive of the president’s willingness to include the private sector in the planned economic stimulus measures,” Peach said.
