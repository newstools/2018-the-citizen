Some of the largest institutions in South Africa have decided to pursue claims on behalf of their clients and funds that suffered losses as a result of the collapse in the share price of global retailer Steinhoff last December, Dutch law firm BarentsKrans said on Friday.
The clients and funds of Abax Investments, Allan Gray, Bateleur Capital, Coronation, Denker, Electus, Eskom, Investec Asset Management, Investec Wealth & Investment, Momentum, Old Mutual, Sanlam, Tantalum Capital, Truffle, and Visio Capital collectively held approximately 20% of the total shareholding in Steinhoff at the time of the collapse.
The institutions have concluded that the class action case being run in the Netherlands by BarentsKrans is their preferred legal route and are proposing to their clients that they participate in the case, which will be heard by the District Court of Amsterdam.
It covers shareholders that acquired shares in Steinhoff from June 26 2013 to December 6 2017.
Martijn van Maanen, a partner at BarentsKrans, said: “The decision by many of South Africa’s largest institutional investors to participate in the BarentsKrans Steinhoff litigation follows a long evaluation process by many of them.”
The case is being fully funded by Claims Funding Europe, a litigation funding company based in Ireland.
