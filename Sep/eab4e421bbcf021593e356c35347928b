We all have horror stories to tell about our experiences on the roads. And while most probably involve the drivers of minibus taxis, they are not the only culprits.
South Africans are notoriously bad drivers, a fact proven by the statistics of road accident fatalities.
The fact is that any single trip in a motor vehicle is potentially one’s last. And, in many instances, alcohol plays a part when it comes to the tragedies on our roads.
I remember as a primary school pupil – that was before we became learners – we used to go to a bicycle track where we were taught about road rules.
The track was operated by the local traffic department. It was a maze of little roads and we peddled along, stopping at the miniature traffic lights, yielding for pedestrians and following the instructions of the traffic officers on duty.
They were real municipal spietkops as we used to call them. We were divided into teams, taking turns to be the “motorists” and the “pedestrians”.
I don’t know when the authorities decided to abandon that project and what their reasons were, but I do suspect it had something to do with money – or the lack thereof to be more specific.
Common sense dictates that teaching children from a very young age about the traffic rules and regulations – and road safety in particular – cannot be a bad thing.
And teaching them about the dangers of drinking and driving, should surely be compulsory learning in every school.
Keeping this in mind, I was flabbergasted when the powers that be decided to legalise the growing and smoking of dagga.
Chances are there will be a marked increase in the number of people getting behind a steering wheel while stoned.
It will be interesting to look at the statistics of road accidents in years to come.
But then again, maybe the figures will show there’s truth in the saying: “Why drink and drive when you can smoke and fly?”
