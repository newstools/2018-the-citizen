Today the Citizen Trail 2018 took place and amateur and seasoned runners had the opportunity to test their mettle between three race distances – 1km, 10km or 6km.
Surrounded by the beauty of Sun City and the Gary Player Resort, runners worked up a sweat in the spring sunshine. Our photographer Michel Bega was on hand to snap runners having a great time. Congrats to all who participated.
