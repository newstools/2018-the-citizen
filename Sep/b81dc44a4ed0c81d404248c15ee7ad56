President Cyril Ramaphosa has left for a state visit to China hosted by President Xi Jinping in Beijing, the presidency said on Saturday.
Ramaphosa would “leverage this visit to step up his drive to attract investment into the South African economy to stimulate inclusive growth and create employment”, the presidency said in a statement.
“The president will position South Africa as an attractive destination for Chinese investors while facilitating opportunities for South African enterprises to engage in the Chinese economy through trade and investment,” it said.
Ramaphosa would also “mobilise” Chinese financing for infrastructure development and promote South Africa as a desirable tourism destination for Chinese.
Ramaphosa’s visit to China was at the invitation of Jinping and reciprocated Ramaphosa’s hosting of his counterpart on a state visit on July 24, on the eve of the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (Brics) summit in Johannesburg.

Ramaphosa would also attend and co-chair the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation summit from September 3 to 4 under the theme: “China and Africa: Towards an even stronger community  with a shared  future through win-win co-operation”.
