Gavin van Zyl-trained three-time winner Kateecador has the right credentials to claim top honours at the Greyville Polytrack today when teamed up with Warren Kennedy in Race 7, a Pinnacle Stakes (F&M) over 1000m.
Kennedy was aboard this filly in her last three outings when a clear-cut winner in a 1000m MR 80 Handicap at the Polytrack which she followed up with a gutsy short-head second in a 1200m feature event at the same venue.
Then in her subsequent outing when switched to turf and carrying 59kg at Greyville she ran out a decisive winner on yielding ground in a 1000m MR 87 Handicap.
This four-year-old should complete the double with the advantage of a favourable inside draw.
But expect a challenge from Louis Goosen-trained Captain’s Girl (Sherman Brown) who heads the weights. This five-time winning mare comes off two bright runs in Pinnacle contests over 1000m at Scottsville where she was third and then a decisive 2.25-length winner. That win was a stout effort as it was her first outing after a three-month break.
Also to be respected is Shane Humby-trained four-time winner Neala (Donovan Dillon) who has been holding form well and confirmed her current wellbeing with a promising close second with Dillon aboard in a 1000m MR 88 Handicap.
