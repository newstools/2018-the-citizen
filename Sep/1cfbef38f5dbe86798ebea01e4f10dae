“ER24 paramedics were alerted to this incident after the Hoedspruit Medical Rescue arrived on the scene and assessed the patients. Assessments showed that a mother, believed to be in her 30s, as well as a three-year-old boy, had sustained numerous injuries and were both in a critical condition,” Hannes Meiring from ER24 told Letaba Herald.
The mother and child were treated for their injuries by Hoedspruit Medical Rescue and thereafter rushed to a nearby airfield where the two ER24 Oneplan Helicopters were waiting.
