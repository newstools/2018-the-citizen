Eswatini King Mswati III has called for Africa to play a bigger role in the work of the United Nations, pointing out that as most of the world body’s peacekeeping missions are based on the continent, Africans needs to be more involved.
The king made his call on Wednesday during the 3rd session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 73) annual debate in New York.
“Africa calls for the allocation of not less than two permanent seats, with all the prerogatives and privileges of permanent membership – including the right of veto; and five non-permanent seats, in the United Nations Security Council,” stated the monarch of the tiny Southern African kingdom previously known as Swaziland.
Turning to development, he said that with strong national leadership and international cooperation, achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring social welfare, gender equality, and tackling many other issues in Africa was within reach.
“We remain confident that the Goals and Agenda 2063 of the African Union will continue to give us the proper guidance and impetus necessary to eradicate poverty and create inclusive and sustainable development for all,” said King Mswati.
