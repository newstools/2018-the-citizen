Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko is among the fabulous nominees for the 10th Annual Feather Awards which are set to take place later this year.
The former ANC head of communications has been nominated alongside the likes of Bonang Matheba, Rami Chuene and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, to name a few.
The Feather Awards are an annual awards show that seeks to recognise and celebrate the LGBTI community and iconic personalities and achievers who inspire the community as voted for by the community.
2018 is a major milestone for the Feathers as the award show turns 10 this year and to celebrate, the organisation will honour gay human rights icon Simon Nkoli by naming this year’s theme after him.

“The theme, ‘Simon Nkoli: Honoring the past, claiming the future’, pays homeage to Simon Nkoli on the year that marks the 20th anniversary of his death,” said Thami “Dish” Kotlolo, founder of the Feather Awards and self-proclaimed president of the ANC LGBTI league.
According to The Daily Post, Nkoli was one of the first black anti-apartheid activists to come out as gay and HIV positive, and he fought tirelessly for the inclusion of gay and lesbian rights in the Constitution.
