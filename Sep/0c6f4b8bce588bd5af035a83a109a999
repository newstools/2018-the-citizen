Road users and taxi drivers have existed in a contentious relationship for years but tensions came to a head in recent weeks after reports emerged of drivers targeting lift clubs and other private transport initiatives.


Eastern Cape taxi drivers handed over a list of demands to the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) earlier this month in an effort to remedy the situation. Fake lists of alleged demands then began circulating on social media and have since shocked people who believe they are real.

The list immediately sent social media users into a frenzy.










Journalist Siphe Macanda rubbished the list, however, and tweeted an image of the real demands.


Secretary-general of Santaco’s Eastern Cape branch Vusumizi Mbewu has denied the fake demands.
“We have nothing to do with that. We know nothing about that one. We are distancing ourselves from that one as Santaco Eastern Cape,” said Mbewu.
He went on to explain that the real demands listed his association’s complaints about how the Eastern Cape government handles things such as scholar transport, termination of contracts, road conditions and the incongruence in validity periods for public drivers’ permits and drivers’ licences.
According to Mbewu, they were also calling for subsidies in the taxi industry as they had established themselves as a more formal entity and would like to offer their association as a sort of pilot project in government’s efforts to develop a system for nationwide taxi subsidies.
They are currently awaiting feedback from government officials after a meeting they attended earlier this week.
