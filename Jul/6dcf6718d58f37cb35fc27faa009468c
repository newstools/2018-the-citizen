Reports of another ‘suspicious device’ in Durban emerged on Monday morning. The device was allegedly found in an underground parking lot at the Pavilion Shopping Centre in Durban this morning.




Last week, two incendiary devices were found at both Gateway and Pavilion Shopping Centres, in the Woolworths menswear section of both malls.
These devices were said to have started a fire, but not an explosion.

A police bomb squad and dogs are currently at the scene, which has been cordoned off.
Explosive devices were also found near the Durban July in a parking lot this past weekend, which were safely detonated by police.
This is a developing story. More to follow as information becomes available.
