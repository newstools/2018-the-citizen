A woman was evacuated to hospital after falling and breaking a leg while hiking in Hekpoort, northwest of Johannesburg, on Sunday morning, paramedics said.
Netcare 911 paramedics responded at about 11.15am to reports of a person who had slipped and fallen in a mountainous area in Hekpoort, Netcare 911 spokesman Shawn Herbst said.
“Reports from the scene indicate that an adult female, believed to be in her 60s, was on a hiking trail with a group of people when she lost her footing and fell, sustaining a fracture to her lower leg.”
The woman was treated on the scene, and with the assistance of Mountain Rescue the woman was carried to a waiting ambulance. She was then transported to hospital for further treatment, Herbst said.
