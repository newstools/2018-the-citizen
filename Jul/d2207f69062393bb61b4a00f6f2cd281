Despite the high unemployment rate in South Africa, some government departments and provincial governments are still failing to fill thousands of vacant posts.
This was revealed in the state of the public sector report released by the Public Service Commission on Tuesday.
The report, which looked at the sector between January and March 2018, revealed that the public sector vacancy rate improved by 1.5% from the previous quarter, but a huge number of posts remained vacant.
“As at March 2018, the Public Service had 1 303 607, of which 1 174 301 were filled, and 129 306 [9.9%] were vacant. The vacancy rate, therefore, has improved by 1.5%,” the report read.
The Eastern Cape led the provinces with 29 240 vacant posts, while the Northern Cape came in last with 3 547 unfilled vacancies.

The commission said the highest vacancy rate (66 790 posts, 52%) was at an administrative or operational level within the overall public service.
“The second highest is at salary levels 9-12 [60 395 posts, 47%], which is junior and middle management level and the level at which most employees have developed specialist skills. This statistic remains more or less the same from the previous quarter,” the report read.
