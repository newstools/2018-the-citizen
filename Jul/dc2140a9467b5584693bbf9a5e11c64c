Sars has just opened the 2018 tax season. For many individuals, this is a cause of substantial stress. That’s why we’re glad the Rosebank Killarney Gazette has broken down everything you need to know to get your ducks in a row.


Tax Reference Number
In order to file your tax returns you need a tax reference number. SARS will not provide your tax number to another person, unless the person is your tax practitioner or has power of attorney to conduct your tax affairs. This is how you can get your tax reference number:

Ask your employer for it.
Get it on the notice of registration you received from the SARS.
Visit your nearest SARS branch with your ID for authentication purposes.
Get it on eFiling if you are registered as an eFiler. Simply login and locate your number on the income tax work page.

Don’t file a return if ALL the criteria below apply to you

Your total employment income or salary for the year (March 2017 to February 2018) before tax (gross income) was not more than R350 000.
You only received employment income for the full year of assessment (March 2017 to February 2018) from one employer.
You have no car allowance, company car, travel allowance or other income (e.g interest or rental income).
You are not claiming tax related deductions. e.g medical expenses, retirement annuity contributions other than pension contributions made by your employer.
