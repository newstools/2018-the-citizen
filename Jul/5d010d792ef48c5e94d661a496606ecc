Correctional services spokesperson Mocheta Monama said Phetla was serving a 30-year sentence for kidnapping and attempted murder.
“According to the preliminary investigation, the deceased used hospital sheets to make a rope, which he tied on the window pane to hang himself.”
Phetla had reportedly attempted to take his own life on two previous occasions.
Monama previously said there were “no signs” he was a danger to himself.
“The hospital staff was astounded because he never showed any signs of danger towards himself or fellow inmates.”
The deceased had been in specialised care since 2013.
His condition had “stabilised”, according to the department.
“The department worked continuously with other health institutions to ensure the inmate received the best medical attention until the last day.”
