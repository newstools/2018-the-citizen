The body of a 21-year-old woman who was missing has been found in Wellington, Western Cape police said today.
Spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said Chantelle Matthyssen’s body was yesterday found under branches on a farm in the Boland town.
“The Kuils River woman disappeared after she went to Wellington for a job allegedly organised by a family friend. Matthyssen was last seen on 23 June when she left her home,” said Rwexana.
“The circumstances related to this incident are under investigation.  A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death.”
A 47-year-old man was arrested yesterday in connection with her murder. He is expected to appear in the Wellington Magistrate’s Court tomorrow.
