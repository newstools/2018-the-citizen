Jamieson added: “The paramedic driving the ambulance slowed down to navigate a speed bump when he saw the men approaching the vehicle armed with handguns. Reacting instinctively, he sped up before the men could action their intentions.”
The suspects reportedly ran after the ambulance, pointing guns at it. Fortunately the paramedics and the patient were not injured in this incident.
The incident was reported to the South African Police Service.
