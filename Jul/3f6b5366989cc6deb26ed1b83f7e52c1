Trade union Solidarity on Monday said it would reveal the extensively written undertakings it had received from South African Airways (SAA).
According to the union, these undertakings have come as a result of its intention to bring an application to the courts to have embattled national carrier SAA placed under business rescue.
Solidarity had made a number of demands during talks between SAA chief executive Vuyani Jarana and Dirk Hermann, Solidarity’s chief executive.
“Some of the undertakings have major strategic implications for SAA,” Hermann said.
During a scheduled press conference on Tuesday in Centurion, Solidarity will also release a summary of its court application of more than a thousand pages. The way forward will also be discussed as far as the business rescue application is concerned.
