Metro police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minaar said the ‘Buya Mthetho’ operation was still ongoing because it was a way of getting motorists to comply with the road regulations.
“There has been a lot of complaints of bad traffic behaviour on Jan Smuts Avenue,” Minnaar said.
“There is a traffic light that has been knocked over on Jan Smuts over the weekend. That is an indication of the kind of behaviour we see. There are also complaints of drivers ignoring red traffic lights, driving over arrows and failing to signal when turning. We are not targeting taxi drivers, the focus is on general law enforcement,” the metro police spokesperson said.
