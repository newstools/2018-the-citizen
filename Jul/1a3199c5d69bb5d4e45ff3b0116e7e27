Haiti’s prime minister Jack Guy Lafontant on Saturday announced the suspension “until further notice” of an unpopular fuel price hike that had triggered a wave of violent protests across the Caribbean nation.
Just before the declaration, the leader of Haiti’s lower house of parliament had threatened a government takeover if the fuel price increases were not reversed.
