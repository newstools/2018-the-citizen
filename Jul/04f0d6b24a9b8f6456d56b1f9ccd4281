According to a statement released by the department of basic education, the hoax message that has been doing the rounds has caused much confusion in the education sector, reports Bosveld Review.
The fake message reads:
“Att: District Directors

The department has reiterated that this message is not official communication from the Presidency as purported.
“The originators sought to create anxiety and uncertainty in our schools. The department has official channels of communication with all our schools, and does not communicate such important information via social media. Our schools went on recess on 22 June, and will resume on 17 July 2018 as per the school calendar approved two years ago,” the statement read.
The department added they expected all learners and educators alike to report for duty as scheduled to start the third term without any further delays.
The statement added the Mandela and Sisulu centenary celebrations would proceed without causing disruptions in schools.
“This malicious social media message is therefore contrary to what both our late leaders stood for. We would advise that those who receive the message to inform the sender that it is fake news and delete the message to ensure that further confusion is averted,” the statement concluded.
