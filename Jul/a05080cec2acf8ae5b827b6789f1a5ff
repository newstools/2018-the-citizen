Speaking on Metro FM, Somgaga lifted the lid on an open letter posted on Twitter in the form of a video by comedian, Careless De (@CarelessDe), who slammed the Idols judge and his “gay friends” for “dressing like clowns”.
“I found it (the open letter) offensive and homophobic then I challenged the Human Rights Commission. I said to them, ‘I am challenging you. The same way you made it illegal and a crime for someone to use the K-word, it is the same thing I want from now on’,” he said.
The comedian told TshisaLIVE that the video he shared was a joke and that he didn’t mean to offend anyone
“The video I posted was just a joke and I do apologise to those I have offended,” he said.
