Many would-be criminals in South African townships face harsh “justice” from bystanders if they get caught in the act, or cornered after committing a criminal offence.
When confronted by a baying crowd they could easily lose their lives due to the mob justice meted out, and are fortunate if they get rescued by police before they get beaten to death.
A burglar caught red-handed by homeowners in Soweto didn’t exactly get “mob justice”, but was certainly taught a lesson he wouldn’t easily forget.
And he’s one of the lucky ones … at least he is alive and has the opportunity to reconsider his choice of career and ponder a less dangerous future.
What happened. WARNING: Violent content, may be upsetting.

It’s not clear if the culprit was handed over to the police after his “lesson” concluded.
