Two people appeared briefly in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court today on a charge of trafficking a person.
John Chijoke Ndum, 35, and Ebellenna Agbim, 38, were arrested on Thursday last week by members of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation’s serious and organised crime investigation unit and Milnerton police officers.
The DPCI, or Hawks, said in statement that the arrests came after a woman, 26, escaped after being held against her will, and alerted authorities that she was forced into prostitution and to use drugs.
“The victim was allegedly recruited under false pretences after she was offered a lucrative employment opportunity. She travelled from Johannesburg to Cape Town on 15 February 2018,” the statement said.
The woman was being cared for at a “safe-house” while officers continued their investigation.
The two accused would remain in custody until their next court appearance on September 4, when they are expected to apply for bail.
