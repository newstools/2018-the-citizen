In a late-night press briefing, President Cyril Ramaphosa was due to address the nation on a number of apparently pressing matters.
The primary announcement was that the ruling party will be supporting an amendment to the constitution to make land expropriation without compensation legal.





Although the party officially agreed to make land expropriation without compensation part of its policy at its elective conference in December, the party has been investigating the “modalities” of how this will be done, while parliament conducts public hearings into the issue after a motion was passed in parliament to change the constitution.


The ANC’s Twitter account said that he would be talking about the ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) lekgotla resolutions taken, “particularly on land redistribution and a stimulus package for jobs and economic growth”.


Earlier in the day, the party was updating followers about its lekgotla.
