“After a thorough inspection was conducted, it was discovered that 120 Maxam Magex cartridges were stolen. It is believed that the reason for the theft of these explosives might be to supply daring and vicious gangs who are hell-bent on committing Cash-In-Transit robberies, ATM bombings, and other related violent crimes,” said Hlathi.
Anyone who has information that may lead to the arrest of suspects and recovery of the explosives is requested to contact Detective Captain Rian Douglas on 0842304630.
