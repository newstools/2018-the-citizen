Two have been found dead and a third has been injured after a fire in a Durban flat, the Northern Natal Courier has reported.
A huge crowd has gathered outside a flat on Willson Street, where the two men were just found dead. The block of flats is located near Danny Motor Spares, and is known colloquially as Beraâ€™s Flats.
The men, Nigerian nationals, are believed to have accidentally started a fire in their flat in a wok and were overcome by the carbon monoxide.
A third man was rushed to hospital.
Police are on the scene and awaiting forensic experts to comb the flat.
At this stage, foul play is not suspected.
