All 12 boys and their football coach have been rescued from a Thai cave after an 18 day ordeal, the Thai Navy Seals said in a Facebook post, adding they were “safe”.
“All 12 ‘Wild Boars’ and coach have been extracted from the cave,” the post said, adding “all are safe” and signing off with a simple “Hooyah”.
Four divers who stayed with the group were still to emerge, it added.
