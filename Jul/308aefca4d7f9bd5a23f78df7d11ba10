Today marks a century since the birth of world-renowned South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela. 
To honour the selflessness and voluntarism of South Africa’s first democratically elected president – a man who spent 27 years imprisoned on Robben Island along with other freedom fighters – people have been called upon to contribute 67 minutes of their time towards community service, making sacrifices for others in need, from painting schools and clinics to feeding the hungry.
