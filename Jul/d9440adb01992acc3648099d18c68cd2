The battle for Gauteng ANC deputy chairman has come down to a clash between education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, former Johannesburg mayor Parks Tau, and economic development MEC Lebogang Maile.
More people were initially nominated for the position – Tshepo Zwane, provincial executive committee member Thoko Magagula, and Emfuleni mayor Jacob Khawe. The three declined nomination, leaving Maile, Tau, and Lesufi to go head to head.
Acting provincial chairman David Makhura was elected unopposed in the early hours of Saturday.
Regions such as Tshwane and Ekurhuleni wanted a younger person to take over as Makhura’s deputy to ensure ”generational mix” in the ANC top leadership.
Of the five regions, Ekurhuleni has the largest delegation at the conference, and could be the kingmaker as to who gets elected into the provincial leadership.
Other nominees for the top five party posts are Khawe and West Rand district municipality mayor Boyce Maneli for secretary. Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko, Shaka Radebe, and Rebecca Dikgamela are contesting for deputy secretary, while Tau, Ekuhuleni mayor and chairman Mzwandile Masina, and Ellen Tshabalala vie for treasurer.
Delegates at the the provincial conference currently under way in Irene, Tshwane had begun voting by 4am. Election results are expected later on Saturday.
