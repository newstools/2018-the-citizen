The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) has come under fire for the use of a right-wing cartoonist’s image as the feature image for one of their latest media releases.


Twitter user  @ex_post_facto retweeted the tweet asking “why is @OUTASA using the services of a white supremacist cartoonist who pushes far right Race and IQ theories and runs a platform that hosts racist anti-black gollywog cartoons?”
@ex_post_facto then followed up the tweet with images of some of Jerm’s previous work.


Self-described as South Africa’s 39th best cartoonist, Jerm has been active since 2005 and has been published in the Sunday Times, The Star, City Press, Rapport, Beeld, The Times, FHM, Playboy, Rolling Stone, Daily Maverick, The New Age, EWN, eNCA to name a few.
His views appear to have moved considerably to the right since he started and his work is currently rarely found in mainstream publications.
Jerm appears to have lobbied to crowd-fund cartoons on race and IQ theory on message boards and seems to be proud of producing work that “no editor or cartoonist wants to go near.”
Jerm is also associated with AltToons, a page he reportedly started to create a space for work that is not politically correct and which has hosted cartoons featuring popular anti-black imagery (gollywogs) from the late 19th century.

Various Twitter users added to @ex_post_facto’s thread with more work associated with Jerm and they criticized OUTA for its use of his content.








OUTA has yet to respond to the criticism.
