Traffic around the FNB Stadium is set to be a nightmare as organisers of the Global Citizen Mandela 100 Festival are expecting to fill up the 90,000 capacity stadium when the free concert begins later today.
As such, the Johannesburg Metro Police Department has issued an advisory warning commuters to either avoid the area or take note of the road closures when planning their trips.


“Soweto highway will be blocked as from midnight to Nasrec road and N1. Motorists can make use of N12 as the alternative route. Metro police officers will be on duty to direct traffic around FNB stadium. The concert starts at [11am],” said JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar, speaking to SABC news.

In addition to deploying more than 120 personnel to work in and around the stadium, the JMPD urged people to use the park and ride facilities organized by concert organisers.


Those who cannot attend can watch the festivities on DSTV channel 199, SABC, MTV and online.
