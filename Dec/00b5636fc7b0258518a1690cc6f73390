“On closer inspection, paramedics found one man lying inside his vehicle. Assessments showed that the man had sustained numerous injuries and was in a critical condition. Paramedics immediately extricated the man and began their treatment. Unfortunately, after some time, the man succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead.”
Two people from the second car were assessed and found to have sustained minor to moderate injuries. They were treated for their injuries and thereafter transported to a nearby hospital for further treatment, Meiring said.
