Southern African energy company Sasol has dominated the Twitter trends list after various social media users took to social media to share harrowing tales of the violence they fell prey to while waiting for transport at the Sasol garage located near FNB Stadium.

Shortly after concertgoers made it home safely after running for their lives, getting robbed, and escaping rape attempts, they took to social media to chronicle their brushes with ruthless criminals.
While most experiences were horrific, some shared stories of the good samaritans who helped them out of situations that could have ended badly.

After hearing that police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said only one case had been reported, Twitter users went on even more of a tweet rampage.
Naidoo said although social media tells a different tale, most of the reports were only published on social media and not filed as actual reports of crime police stations.


Speaking during a media briefing in Port Elizabeth, police minister Bheki Cele urged victims to file actual cases as the police cannot do anything without it.


Police Minister Bheki Cele called on victims of crime to come forward: “There is no need to blame South African police that there was no Uber, there was no transport and all that – that should be asked from the organisers.”
Neither Sasol nor the owners of that particular petrol station have issued any statements.
