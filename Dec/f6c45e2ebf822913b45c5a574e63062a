On Tuesday night, power utility Eskom warned South Africans that the risk of Stage 2 rotational load shedding would remain high for Wednesday.
This morning, Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe confirmed it for most of the rest of today.


On Tuesday, the utility also implemented power supply cuts between 9am and 10pm due to a shortage of capacity, which Phasiwe said they were working day and night to rectify.


Phasiwe said on Tuesday the situation is only likely to improve from Friday as a number of power generating units remain out of service.
