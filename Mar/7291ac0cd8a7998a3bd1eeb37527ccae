South Africa were 75 for one at lunch after winning the toss and batting on the best batting pitch of any of the Tests South Africa have hosted against India and Australia this season.
Elgar and Amla were unbeaten on 40 and 31 respectively.
Josh Hazlewood struck early for Australia when he dismissed Aiden Markram for nought in the fourth over. Markram pushed forward at a full-length delivery and edged a low catch to Australian captain Steve Smith at second slip.
Although there was a good covering of grass, there was minimal assistance for the bowlers on a sunny morning. Elgar and Amla started cautiously and the total was only 31 after 15 overs in the first hour.
They posted a 50 partnership after 80 minutes and 110 balls and by lunch had stretched this to 69 off 146 balls.
Proteas: Aiden Markram, Dean Elgar, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Faf du Plessis (c), Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock, Vernon Philander, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel
