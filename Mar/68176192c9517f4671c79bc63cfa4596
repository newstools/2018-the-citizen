The trial against Forum 4 Service Delivery Councillor Napoleon Webster and 13 others resumes in the North West High Court sitting in Mogwase on Monday.
Webster and 13 other men from Marikana are facing a charge of murder.
The others are Aubrey Seitsang, Sibonile Sobopha, Mdlondozi Fundiwo, Herbert Baqhesi, Forum 4 Service Delivery councillor Napoleon Webster, William Nyenyane, Aphindile Pungone, Samson Gqwetani, Gift Luveli, Nkululeko Msithwa, Nkosindiphile Nziyose, Luvo Soyizwaphi, Sivuyile Qasha and Mzolisi Mbulana.
The accused allegedly hacked Sabata Petros Chale, 39, to death in Marikana West, on 8 December 2016. The attack was allegedly sparked by a dispute over the allocation of free low-cost RDP houses at Marikana West Extension 2.
Doctor Moeti Isaac Siko, who conducted an autopsy, told the court Chale was stabbed several times.
The doctor said Chale had multiple lacerations on his head and stab wounds on the shoulder, chest and stomach. His left lung was punctured and had collapsed.
Dr Siko said the cause of death was multiple injuries and “sharp force trauma”.
All the accused deny any involvement in the murder, described by the state as premeditated.
