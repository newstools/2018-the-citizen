Proteas team management on Monday morning confirmed that Quinton de Kock and Australian vice-captain were involved in a heated bust-up during the tea break on the fourth day of the first Test between the sides at Kingsmead.
CCTV footage had emerged late on Sunday evening, showing how Warner had to be restrained by his teammates, while an ICC official also came out to intervene.
It’s not known whether the official felt the verbal exchange might’ve become physical.

“It’s rather unfortunate that the incident took place and certainly not in the spirit of the game,” said Proteas team manager Mohammed Moosajee in a statement.
“The match referee had spoken to us after the day’s play. We will await any further communication from the ICC around this incident.”
Tensions between the Proteas and Warner in particular seemed to simmer after he effected AB de Villiers’ run-out in South Africa’s second innings.
The fiery left-handed opener seemed to taunt Aiden Markram, the home side’s hero with a brilliant innings of 143, for being the culprit in dismissing his experienced batting partner.
Aussie off-spinner Nathan Lyon also didn’t help the situation by dropping the ball close to De Villiers while he was still lying on the ground after being caught short of his crease.
Markram, for his part, seemed to downplay the verbal exchanges between the sides.
“It’s natural when you play against the Australians that there’s a lot of chatter on the field. I certainly don’t mind. It never really gets out of line either, not a lot of swearing or things like that happen,” he said.
