The following video of a woman hitting another woman in public went viral on social networks since mid-week.
In the video the one woman, presumably a manager at a store, can be heard saying: “I will not lay my hands on an employee.”
The other woman just keeps trying to attack her and at one point kicks her after having earlier slapped her. Her “victim” then says that she’s firing the younger woman and lets rip with a stream of verbal abuse.
The exact details about this clip are not known.
