The Pretoria High Court has dismissed public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s bid to appeal the personal costs order in the Absa/Bankorp review application.
Last month, a full bench of the court set aside the public protector’s finding that R1.125 billion must be recovered from Absa Bank for the Bankorp bailout in the mid-1980s.
The court ordered Mkhwebane to pay 85% of the costs of Absa and the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) in her official capacity, but to personally pay 15% of the costs.
This is a developing story. More to follow.
