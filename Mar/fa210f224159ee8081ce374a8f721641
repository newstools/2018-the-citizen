Madonsela delivered the keynote address at the Beyers Naudé Memorial Lecture at the University of Zululand’s KwaDlangezwa campus on Tuesday.
Attending the lecture were Dlangezwa High school Grade 12 pupils Thandiswa Nyawo, Zakithi Jobe and Thembeka Zondi
Under the slogan ‘The evil in our midst’, she said it would be fitting to honour the spirit of Naudé by promoting the rights of women and children.
“Just like Naudé we must promote a peaceful world with justice for everyone.”

Madonsela said society should look at two aspects of abuse – prevention and addressing trauma – while also considering how perpetrators can be rehabilitated.
“Contented people don’t abuse others. It is important to find the source of abuse and then how to help.
Contributing to the dialogue was Government and Media Relations Manager: Sonke Gender Justice Commissioner Mbuyiseni Botha
“For abusers to heal, we also have to ensure we don’t remind them of their wrongdoings when they have been rehabilitated and want to turn over a new leaf,” said Madonsela.
