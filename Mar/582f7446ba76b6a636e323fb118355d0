The net is closing around the notorious Gupta brothers for the role they played in the alleged looting of South African resources through state capture.The Times of India reports from Dehradun that the brothers have until March 26 to appear before the Indian Income Tax (I-T) department.This is in connection with money laundering and “amassing properties in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and NCR”.The Gupta properties have been raided in Dehradun and Saharanpur, which are situated about 70km apart in the north Indian region where the brothers have been spotted.According to the Times of India the Guptas had until last Friday to appear in front of officials, but requested through their representative that they needed another month in order to do so. The request was then refused by the department, which only granted them an extension of another 10 days.“If the brothers still do not turn up then necessary action would be taken as per I-T rules. A representative of the Gupta brothers had come to the I-T office in Dehradun, seeking a month’s time. He did not disclose the reasons for seeking the extension, so he was allowed 10 more days,” an official was quoted to have said.Reports have indicated brothers Ajay and Atul may be in Dubai. Ajay has been named a fugitive from justice by South African authorities and has been red-flagged by Interpol.– Citizen reporterFor more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
