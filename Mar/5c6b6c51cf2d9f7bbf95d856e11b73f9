Technology firm Altron said on Wednesday its subsidiary Bytes Systems Integration had been awarded multiple tenders worth nearly R220 million to support the South African Post Office (Sapo) with biometric technology as it gets ready to take over the payment of social security grants.
Altron said the system would verify beneficiaries’ identities through biometric technology connected directly and in real-time, to the Home Affairs National Identification System as well as the Sapo biometric verification engine.
“We are pleased the biometric solution will assist Sapo to have a positive impact on people’s lives, eliminating forgery and criminal activity in the grant dispensation process,” Bytes Systems Integration managing director Leslie Moodley said.
Following an agreement signed in December between Sapo and the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa), the post office is set to take over paying grants to some 17 million South African recipients.
BSI has secured several contracts with Sapo, which include supplying, installing and providing support for biometric fingerprint readers and web cameras as well as training Sapo support users.
