The Gauteng department of education says the three-month deadline for the eradication of pit toilets in the province’s schools is “too much time” and has pledged to finalise infrastructure issues in just two weeks.
This commitment was made at the Regina Mundi Catholic Church in Soweto, where the Motsepe Foundation donated millions to the Gauteng education department (GED) to improve the infrastructure in schools around the area.
GED spokesperson Steve Mabona says the impact of the foundation will go a long way to improving school facilities. “If you look at the infrastructures of our schools, this (donation) will go a long way to assist schools, as you might have heard they have already committed to utilise this money mostly on the improvement on infrastructure,” he says. Mabona says the department is happy with the improvements they have made on ablution facilities since 2014. “We were given three months by the minister and the president. For us three months is too much time. It’s just a matter of appointing service providers who can look at those toilets and demolish them. Within the coming two weeks or so, we should be done with the process.”
