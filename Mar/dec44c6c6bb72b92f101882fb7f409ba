Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi told the Limpopo legislature today there were chances that more people might contract listeriosis.
He was updating the legislature on the listeriosis outbreak.
Capricorn FM reports the minister said he would be meeting with health MECs across the country and his counterparts from countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
The station reported that he further warned members of the public not to consume processed meats from other brands besides the ones identified last week because processed meat products are packed next to each other in supermarkets, which could lead to cross-contamination.
The Enterprise factory in Polokwane was identified as the source of the outbreak.
Enterprise and Rainbow products have since been recalled in efforts to contain the spread of the diseases.
He further said washing hands with soap and water before handling food or after using the toilet was essential to ensure that one did not contract the disease.
“I got worried this week. I saw a document which showed research which shows that 62% of men do not wash their hands after leaving the bathroom, they just step into the bathroom and they walk out with hands in their pockets,” he said.
He added cooking food thoroughly was also important because the listeria bacteria was very sensitive to heat and that members of the public should avoid consuming half-cooked food.
More than 183 people have lost their lives because of the disease.
A human rights lawyer is launching a class action lawsuit against Tiger Brands, Enterprise’s parent company, for the outbreak and the subsequent deaths.
The company, however, insists that there was no verified evidence linking the deaths to Enterprise products.
