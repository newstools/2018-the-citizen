Civil rights organisation AfriForum says it will consult with its legal team over possible legal action against the EFF and its leader, Julius Malema, after alleged racist remarks that Malema made during a political gathering over the weekend.
Malema said among other things white people should be glad that the EFF did not call for a genocide.
Ernst Roets, deputy CEO of AfriForum, says that these remarks should be considered within the context of Malema’s earlier statements that the EFF does not call for a genocide of white people “yet”.
“The EFF’s remarks are blatantly racist and offensive,” says Roets.
AfriForum laid a complaint earlier this year against the EFF after supporters of this party sang a song with the words “white man, you must die” and “shoot to kill the Boere”.
The EFF’s leadership defended the song in public, adding that they were proud of their supporters’ actions.
