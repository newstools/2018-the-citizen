Motorists have also been cautioned to avoid the R55 leading to Valhalla after a car drove into a sinkhole (pictured). The driver escaped unharmed.
Residents have been asked to avoid all streams and low-lying areas when flooded and were warned not to attempt hazardous crossings.
Houses are flooded and many people report that their roofs are leaking. It was reported that a homeless woman needed to be rescued by emergency workers in flooded Soweto.


Tshwane emergency services spokesperson Johan Pieterse said two cars were stuck in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, and emergency services had to pull them out.
“Several trees have already fallen over all over Pretoria and we expect more to fall because the ground is very wet,” Pieterse said.


He told The Citizen that emergency services were on standby all over the city and that low-water bridges will only be open when it is safe and to relieve the traffic flow.
He said there had been no injuries or deaths reported thus far and he asked people to take extra care.


Pieterse also warned motorists of potholes and said there was a major pothole on the R55 at the back of Atteridgeville in the west of Pretoria.
