It is a sad reality that in the media, once a person is identified as “bad”, then he or she is fair game for character assassination or defamation.
Information which shows that person in a good light is either ignored, downplayed or ridiculed.
We should be very careful indeed in believing everything the Western media feeds us about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He is, we are told, the man with his finger on the nuclear trigger of a Third World War; a brutal dictator who orders opponents removed or murdered and is the most corrupt Russian oligarch.
We are not saying that Putin is a saint. Far from it – for a man to reach the position he has, and with his history as an operative of the KGB secret service in the Soviet era, he cannot be entirely squeaky clean.
Yet, his people have re-elected him their leader and, under him, Russia has been growing as an economic power. That threatens some in the West, who are still fighting the Cold War in their minds.
One needs to keep an open mind on Putin and others who have been demonised. An enemy of London or Washington is not necessarily the enemy of everyone else.
