To all the faithful readers of this website, we apologise for the unprecedented downtime we’ve experienced over the past 12 hours.
In all my time as the digital editor here, it’s never been quite this bad.
Obviously when you’re dealing with gizmos that run on electricity, something is always bound to go wrong at some point, but this one was just really nightmarish.
I had to laugh at the fact that we were permanently stuck with a main story from last night about only four of the five rearrested escapees from Pollsmoor big six escape being caught. I’m sure that was small comfort to escapee number five.
That, at least, was probably not as hilarious as one of our esteemed tabloid dailies today having a completely incorrect story on their front page about a guy throwing himself off a balcony in Port Elizabeth. As you may know by now, that actually happened in America two weeks ago.
But this is the media, and s**t happens.
As I write this, it seems that HMS Citizen.co.za is sailing again after being becalmed in monster-filled IT waters, but it’s likely we’re going to keep going down for some time throughout the day while we fight continued attacks from the Crypto-Kraken.
In the meantime, our archives are still available to mobile readers. We will be working hard to get the site back up to date and have all your favourite news stories and columns loaded as fast as we can.
