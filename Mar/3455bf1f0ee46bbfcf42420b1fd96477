An ambulance crew attending to a woman who was giving birth was robbed at gunpoint in Port Elizabeth, the Eastern Cape department of health says.
Provincial spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo says the incident happened at around 10pm on Wednesday in New Brighton while medics were attending to the mother.
He said two crew members were inside the woman’s house, after she had given birth.
“The female crew member went to the ambulance and was confronted by a male. A scuffle ensued and the other crew member went out to investigate and was confronted by a gun-wielding man who demanded all their belongings, including wallets and cellphones.”
Kupelo said the medics called for help using the ambulance radio. The shift leader and other colleagues rushed to the scene.
“There were community members at the scene but could not assist ambulance crew members. The two robbers disappeared … no one sustained injuries and no shots were fired. Both crew members are fine, but shocked, and will receive psychological treatment.”
The mother and baby were taken to hospital in a healthy condition.
