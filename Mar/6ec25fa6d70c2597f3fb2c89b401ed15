The National Education, Health, and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) has reached an agreement with the Durban University of Technology (DUT) to end a protracted eight-week strike “which was as a results [sic] of the intransigent [sic] of the university management”, Nehawu said on Saturday.
Both parties agreed on a salary increase of seven percent across the board, including a R200 housing allowance, the trade union said in a statement.
The issue of the once-off bonus would be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration (CCMA) for interpretation, because Nehawu viewed it as a change in conditions of service, as the bonus had been paid to workers for the past eight years. The issue of docking of salaries by the university during the strike would be referred to the Labour Court.
The university had agreed that 13 days of the strike would be waived and staff would get their full salaries on March 20. Moreover, the university also agreed to give staff members salary advances up to R12,000 payable over eight months to help them deal with the financial repercussions of the strike, Nehawu said.
“We applaud our members for remaining resolute while the university elected to deploy highhanded tactics, including the usage of teargas and rubber bullets by the M17 private security company employed by the university.
“Our members will return with enthusiasm and vigour to work hard in resuming the academic calendar programme of 2018 at DUT. In this regard, the union wishes to thank all members and workers in general of this institution for preserving unity among themselves, solidarity, and showing commitment in pursuit of our call for decent wage project,” Nehawu said.
