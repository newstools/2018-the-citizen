Four victims aged between 18 and 76 sustained gunshot wounds to the upper body and died on the scene.
One of the victims is a traditional healer and the other a traditional healer trainee.
KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said another victim believed to be in his 30s sustained gunshot wounds and was taken to hospital.
“Two children aged 13 and 16 managed to escape unharmed and sought help from the neighbours.”
The second incident took place 30 minutes later at Ezimbidla in Ekombe.
“Neighbours heard gunshots at 10pm.
“When they checked in the morning, they found that their neighbour, who is also a traditional healer, had been shot dead,” she said.
Gwala said the neighbours found the 70-year-old man’s body in a bush a few metres away from his house.
“He sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the upper body. He was living alone in his house,” she said.
While police will investigate if the two incidents are related, members of the community are being urged to come forward with any information.
The motive for the attacks are unknown at this stage.
