London – Volatile can continue his tremendous run of form in the sunbets.co.uk Handicap at Southwell today.
The four-year-old’s career looked to going backwards last summer, but he appears to have been completely reinvigorated since moving to Jamie Osborne’s yard for 32,000 guineas last October. Since making a pleasing debut for his new connections at Lingfield early in the new year, Volatile has racked up a hat-trick of victories, including two on the Fibresand at Southwell.





Despite not having his own way out in front like he had on his previous two outings, Osborne’s charge fought hard to win his last start a fortnight ago and a 2.5kg hike might not be enough to stop him going in again.



Acker Bilk won as he liked at Southwell less than a week ago and can strike again while the iron is hot in the Betway Middle Distance Handicap. The son of Rip Van Winkle broke his duck in some style at Wolverhampton in early January and following two solid runner-up efforts, the application of cheekpieces eked out enough improvement to help him get back in the winner’s enclosure. Assuming the headgear does the same job at the second time of asking, he must have every chance of following up under the 3kg penalty.



Theglasgowarrior looks set to claim a third Newcastle success in the Betway Handicap. Jim Goldie’s charge won here in December and January and ran a perfectly sound race when third on his latest visit to Gosforth Park last month.



He occupied the same nish- ing position at Wolverhampton last time out and with Phil Dennis taking a handy 1.5kg o his back, this looks a good opportunity for him to get back on the winning trail.



Amuletum looks interesting in the 32Red.com Fillies’ Handicap. She showed up well in her first start for Peter Chapple-Hyam, finishing third, and makes her handicap debut o a mark of just 65. – Press Association
