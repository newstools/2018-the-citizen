Australia coach Darren Lehmann has maintained his innocence in the ball-tampering controversy and called on the public for forgiveness for his three banned players.
Former captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner have both been banned for 12 months from all international cricket for their role in the ball tampering incident during the third Test in Cape Town, while Cameron Bancroft has received a slightly-lesser nine-month suspension.
“They have made a grave mistake, but they are not bad people. As a coach you feel for them … they are hurting, and I feel for them and their families,” said Lehmann on Wednesday.
“There is a human side of this. They have made a mistake as everyone, including myself, has made mistakes in the past.
“Their health and well-being is extremely important to us.”
Lehmann maintained he had no prior knowledge of the plan devised by the trio to alter the condition of the ball.
“The first I saw of it was on that screen and I went straight on the walkie-talkie and said something to Peter [Handscomb].
“There were a couple of expletives in there. Then I spoke to some of the players at tea time and said we’d deal with it at the end of play, which obviously happened through the process.”
