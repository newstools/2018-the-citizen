South African food giant Tiger Brands said on Monday it was immediately recalling its Enterprise ready-to-eat chilled processed meat product range after the health minister identified it over the weekend as the source of a deadly listeriosis outbreak.
“We have contacted all our customers to confirm that the recalled products are removed from their store shelves and will continue to work with authorities to ensure an effective and speedy recall,” the company said.
“Additionally, we have suspended operations at both Enterprise manufacturing facilities (Polokwane and Germiston) and have halted supply to trade.”
