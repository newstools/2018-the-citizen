In 1971, Lyndon B Johnson, then president of the United States, said, in reference to FBI director J Edgar Hoover: “It’s probably better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent pissing in.”
In South Africa, that observation can equally be applied to the ANC’s new kissy-kissy stance on Julius Malema.
The ANC has offered to take Malema – who was unceremoniously booted out of the party six years ago – back into the fold.
Cyril Ramaphosa, one-time sworn enemy of the EFF leader, said: “I should say we would like to have Julius Malema back in the ANC, he is still the ANC deep down in his heart. So, we would love to have those in the EFF back in the ANC; the ANC is their home.”
We wonder if Ramaphosa thinks before he speaks. So, Julius Malema is just like the ANC?
A man who intimidated and strong-armed his way, undemocratically, into the leadership of the ANC Youth League; a man happy to lead violent protests where innocents suffer, such as the H&M demonstrations, and the vile rampages by his Congress of South African Students brethren through the streets of central Johannesburg some years ago; and a man who spouts racism every time he opens his mouth.
Maybe those are the ANC’s true colours.
Malema has clearly stolen the land issue from under the nose of the ANC and continues to embarrass them. He also speaks to the younger generation and the angry generation – the millions of South Africans let down by the ANC since 1994.
So, it would make sense to have him inside the tent, where at least he can be controlled. However, Malema has scornfully rejected the offer. Why should he go back? The ANC, and his extremist utterances, are keeping him alive politically.
