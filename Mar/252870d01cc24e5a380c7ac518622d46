Gauteng public hospitals and clinics are likely to be disrupted today as five trade unions begin a joint protest action to push for the payments of their members’ performance bonuses by the Gauteng health department.The department has promised to address their grievances in its new 2018/19 financial year budget provided this was approved by the provincial cabinet.Department spokesperson Lesemang Matuka said Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa is to take the matter to the executive council for a final decision because it was the executive that earlier decided on the non-payments of the bonuses due to the financial situation the department was facing.“There have been negotiations for some time between the unions and the management of the department on this matter. The MEC had listened to the unions and she promised that this matter would be taken care of in the 2018/19 financial year,” he said.Matuka said Ramokgopa has tabled the matter to the executive council to decide on a course of action.The five unions – Denosa, Nehawu, Public Servants Union, Hospersa and Nupsaw – staged a two-day sit-in at Ramokgopa’s office this week about the payment of the bonuses for the 2016/17 and 2017/18 financial years.But they said their talks with the MEC were fruitless as it became clear that they could not find common ground.“The employer maintained that they don’t have money to pay both and the decision no longer lies with the health department but with the Gauteng government led by the premier.“Put simply, the employer is adamant that they are not going to pay PMDS (performance bonuses) for last year and this year,” a statement from the unions said yesterday.“As unions, we condemn this stance taken by the employer and view it as an attack on the collective bargaining agreement and exploitation of workers,” said Simphiwe Gada from Denosa on behalf of the unions.– ericn@citizen.co.zaFor more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
