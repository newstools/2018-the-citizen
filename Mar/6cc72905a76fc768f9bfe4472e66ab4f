A 14-year-old boy is in a critical condition in hospital after he and another teenager apparently took a vehicle for a “joyride” and crashed the vehicle in Vanderbijlpark, paramedics said on Sunday.
Netcare 911 responded at about 3.15pm on Saturday to reports of a very serious crash on a gravel road – Tucker Road – in the Ardenwold AH area in Vanderbijlpark, Netcare 911 spokesman Nick Dollman said.
“Reports from the scene allege that underage teenagers had taken the vehicle for a joyride which ended in a very serious rollover crash where one of the victims was ejected from the vehicle.
“Netcare 911 advanced life support paramedics were first to arrive at the scene and attended to a 14-year-old male who was in [a] critical condition. He was placed on a ventilator and once stabilised was transported by ambulance to hospital for the urgent care that he required.”
Another teenage boy, also believed to be 14, sustained relatively minor injuries and was transported by ambulance to hospital for further assessment and care. The police were at the scene to investigate the incident, Dollman said.
