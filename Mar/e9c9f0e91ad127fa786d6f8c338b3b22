It has been 19 years since BMW showed the first of the X series during the 1999 Detroit Motor Show.
.
The E53 X5, a four wheel drive vehicle with 62% of the torque being sent to the rear wheels, continued the company’s traditional rear wheel drive sensation. It was marketed as an SAV (Sports Activity Vehicle), as the vehicle’s dynamics were orientated more towards road performance than an SUV’s off road bias.
Over the years, the range has grown, with the introduction of four more derivatives – X1, X3, X4 and X6 – and this has resulted in global sales of 5.4 million units, over 30% of the company’s output.
The introduction of the X1 in 2010 and its subsequent sales figures made it the best seller in the range in 2017, proving that there was a definite demand for the compact SAV.
The compact SUV market has become a very significant player in the world market.
.
The numbers of manufacturers and their model line-up is testimony to this, so it would take something a little different to obtain a solid market share.
BMW have entered the market with a stylish contender – the new X2, which was launched on the local market last week.
Based on the same platform as the X1 and Mini Countryman, the X2 shares the same wheelbase as the X1 but is shorter and lower than its sibling. Very apparent is the styling philosophy which is certainly more coupe than SUV, the long roof and slim window lines supplying a far more svelte appearance.
The traditional kidney grille has been turned on its head, literally, the trapezoidal shape is now inverted, the first time this has featured on a modern BMW.
Another reflection of the past is the company insignia mounted on the C-pillars last seen on the legendary 2000 CS and 3.0 CSL coupe’s of the mid 1960s and 70s.
BMW South Africa has chosen not to introduce the base model offered overseas and has opted for two high specification lines, the M Sport and M Sport X. All models are equipped with 19 inch alloy wheels with 20 inch as an option.
Two four cylinder engines are available from launch, a 2-litre turbocharged petrol and 2-litre turbo diesel, both well proven BMW units.
.
The petrol version delivers 151kW between 5 000 and 6 000 r/min with 280Nm of torque between 1 350 and 4 600 r/min, the acceleration from 0/100km/h is claimed at 7.7 seconds, combined fuel consumption at 6l/100km with CO2 emissions of 138g/km.
The oil burner pushes 140kW at 4 000 r/min with torque of 400Nm between 1 750 and 2 500 r/min, acceleration almost rivals the petrol version at 7.8 seconds, with a consumption of 5l/100km and emissions at 131g/km.
In May this year an entry level X2 will be introduced to SA utilising a 1.5 litre 3-cylinder turbocharged engine with manual transmission.
An automatic version will be available as an option, at a correspondently lower price.
The X2 sDrive20i models are equipped with BMW’s 7-speed dual clutch automatic gearbox driving through the front wheels. Move up to the X2 xDrive20d and you have the 8-speed automatic transmission delivering power to all four wheels.
This is only available on the diesel variants.
.
The cabin does not offer any surprises, being the very familiar BMW layout and high quality finishes.
Boot space is claimed at 470 litres and that can be increased by folding the rear seat which offer a 40/20/40 split.
The launch route in and around Cape Town and into the Boland provided a good combination of roads, with heavy city traffic, freeways and the twisting roads of the mountain passes.
The X2 in both petrol and diesel versions performed very well in all circumstances, provided a smooth, comfortable and quiet ride, despite the 19 inch wheels.
.
Select sport mode and use the optional paddle shift and the fun really starts whether in the petrol or diesel derivative.
