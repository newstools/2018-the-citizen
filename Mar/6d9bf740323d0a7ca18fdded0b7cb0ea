There’s no place for stealing and corruption within the African National Congress (ANC), and those who are implicated in corruption will be punished accordingly, said President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday.
Addressing churchgoers during a Good Friday sermon at the Covenant Fellowship Church International in eSikhaleni in KwaZulu-Natal, Ramaphosa said “the new dawn” brought on by his rise to the Union Buildings meant that things had to change and there must be unity and renewal within the ANC, News24 reported.
“The ANC must serve the people of South Africa. We must put our old ways behind us. Where there was corruption, we must say goodbye to corruption. Where there were people who were stealing the resources of our country, they must be dealt with severely,” Ramaphosa said.
Ramaphosa also called for unity within the governing party.
“There must be unity and renewal of the African National Congress […] Because it is when the ANC is united, that is when we are stronger and I know this church is praying and continues to pray for the unity of the African National Congress,” he said.
