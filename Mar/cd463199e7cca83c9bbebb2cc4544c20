The latest nationwide listeria outbreak has naturally concerned pet parents about what they should and shouldn’t be feeding their pets, Kempton Express reports.Listeriosis is a serious but treatable disease caused by listeria monocytogenes, which is widely distributed in nature and can be found in soil, water and vegetation.“Risks of infection in pets, while possible, is less likely.

One was positive for Salmonella and the other for Listeria greyii. This comes to a 0.4% contamination rate. On the other hand, of the 196 samples of raw dog and cat food, a total of 88 were found to be contaminated – 65 for Listeria, 15 for Salmonella, and eight for E.Coli – a 45% contamination rate.Fyvie says you can prevent your pets from exposure to listeria infections by following these tips:• Pay attention to the news. Any food that is unsafe for you is also unsafe for your pet. Make sure you discard contaminated products properly, you don’t want your pet finding the item later.• Stick to safe treats rather than giving your pet viennas, sausages or cold meats as a reward.• Cook meat thoroughly. If you feed your pet meat make sure it’s been cooked, no matter what it is. Listeria is very heat sensitive, a core temperature of 70°C will kill the bacteria.If you’re worried your pet may have come into contact with any listeria contaminated products; then look out for the following symptoms:• Diarrhoea• Nausea• Fever• Vomiting• Weakness• Lack of coordinationAs a pet parent you may be wondering if your pet can pass the disease onto you?
