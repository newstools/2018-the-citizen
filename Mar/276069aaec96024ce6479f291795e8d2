Citrus fruits contain vitamin C and bioflavonoids, which are both natural antihistamines. In combination, bioflavonoids are said to enhance the health benefits of vitamin C including stronger immunity, detoxification, eye and skin and health, making citrus fruits a powerhouse health as well as allergies.
2. Boost your intake of oily fish
Sardines, mackerel, and salmon are excellent sources of omega 3 fatty acids which is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. This helps to reduce the effect of an allergic reaction by managing the inflammation that causes discomfort, itchiness, and swelling.
