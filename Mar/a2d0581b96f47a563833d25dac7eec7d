Yesterday’s declaration that the prevailing drought conditions across several parts of the country officially amounts to a national state of disaster means the affected localities can finally access emergency funding reserved for national disasters.
The Northern Cape, Western Cape and the Eastern Cape have been hardest hit by the drought.
According to a statement released by Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize yesterday, these funds include a provisional allocation of R6 billion. This amount had been set aside in the 2018-19 financial year for several purposes, which include disaster relief.
There is also an additional R501.2 million for short-term disaster relief grants to provinces and municipalities.
“As the minister responsible for disaster management, I have recognised that special circumstances exist and have decided to declare the drought as a national state of disaster in terms of Section 27 of the Disaster Management Act,” Mkhize announced.
The drought was initially reclassified as a disaster on February 8, but this was not deemed an official declaration, which prohibited access to the funds in question.
There will also be heightened drought intervention programmes, which will include monthly meetings of the national joint drought committee and the establishment of sectoral programmes, which will coordinate efforts in order to avoid duplication of responsibilities.
Mkhize also announced strengthened water management programmes, which aim to intensify maintenance and refurbishment of water infrastructure.
The cooperative governance minister said the process to calculate how much money would be released in total and how it would be applied has begun.
He reminded people to continue saving water as SA remains a water scarce country
