Former president Jacob Zuma says he continues to be persecuted despite his resignation last month as the country’s state president.
Addressing thousands of congregants at a church in Durban on Good Friday, Zuma said he wasn’t “bothering anyone” since he stepped down from office following a decision by the ANC’s national executive committee to recall him. He told churchgoers his enemies were still after him, according to a video clip aired by SABC News.
“Anyone who is being oppressed in different ways and accepts the oppression is committing a sin. I am still struggling while other people are free, I am not freer at all,” Zuma said.
The former president, who faces 16 charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering related to the controversial arms deal scandal, is due to appear in the Durban High Court next week after he was served with summons by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).
Zuma said he never found peace during his tenure as the country’s president.
“You gave me a task to govern for ten years, but I never found peace in all that time. Even when I am no longer the president I am still being followed and I am not troubling anyone.
“I am not amazed by the attacks, church leaders must pray for us,” he said.
He also urged those in attendance to lead people in the right direction “towards God”.
“Beg God for us to soften people’s hearts so that we don’t get to a place that’s not good,” Zuma said.
