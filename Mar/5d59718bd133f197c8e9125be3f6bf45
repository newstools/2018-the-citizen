A short clip from Wednesday’s joint gathering of the police and justice committees to look into alleged delays in arrests pertaining to state capture had the seriousness broken for a minute by one MP who got seriously tongue-tied.
She trended briefly on Twitter after simply giving up on saying: “Justice delayed is justice denied.”
She just couldn’t say it, repeatedly saying “justnis” or similar words.
Try as she might, she eventually just concluded by saying, “Yes, that one.”
Take a look at the clip, which drew comparisons to former president Jacob Zuma unsuccessfully trying to read numbers in his speeches:

The MP in question was responding to the allegation that National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams had dragged his feet on making arrests in the R220 million Estina dairy farm fraud involving the Guptas and their associates.
Members took turns to interrogate Abrahams and acting Hawks head Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata on a perceived lack of action pertaining to members of the Gupta family.
In a parliamentary hearing last week, Matakata had claimed the NPA took months to give the go-ahead for the arrests of those allegedly involved.
Abrahams denied the NPA had dragged its feet, arguing that the cases could take years to investigate and prosecute, adding that the Asset Forfeiture Unit had identified 17 cases with asset forfeiture potential of R50 billion.
The joint committees were not satisfied with the blame game and eventually resolved to call the police and justice ministers to provide further clarity.
There were several reactions to the MP’s performance. Take a look at some of them below.
