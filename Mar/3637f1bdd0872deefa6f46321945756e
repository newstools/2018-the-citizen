Glen Kotzen scored the first blow for Western Cape trainers at the Vaal last Saturday when Silvan Star easily won a Pinnacle Stakes over 1450m on the Classic track.
With Richard Fourie in the irons she had the race won a long way out and second-placed Gimme Six, trained by another Cape Town-based conditioner, Justin Snaith, was a ered to be only 0.90 lengths back at the finish.
On Saturday at Tur ontein the card is headed up by two Grade 2 races carrying prize money of R400,000 – the Senor Santa Stakes over 1160m and the Colorado King Stakes over 2000m.
In the Senor Santa Stakes there is another Cape raider in the eld, Professor Brian, from the Joey Ramsden stable. Fourie has stayed in Joburg and will take the ride on the five-year-old Australian bred son of Encosta De Lago. He has won six of his 19 starts and with just 52kg on his back needs to be respected.
Champagne Haze was a very easy winner over 1000m last time and will be be er over this sort of trip while Will Pays, Green Pepper and Sir David Baird should run well.
Only 10 horses are carded to go to post for the Colorado King Stakes and Fort Ember from the Paul Peter stable is the best handicapped runner.
She ran well last time when a one-length second behind Orchid Island and must go into the mix along with Coral Fever, Abashiri, French Navy and Glider Pilot who will have Fourie up.
Also run on the day are the Grade 2 Sycamore Sprint for fillies and mares over 1160m, as well as the Listed Derby Trial and Oaks Trial, both run over 2000m.



In addition, the $10-million Dubai World Cup at Meydan racecourse will form Race 11 on the Tur ontein card which will add to the thrill of the day.
