In true Mzansi fashion, South Africans have taken a very serious problem and managed to make light of it.
All processed meats from Tiger Brands’ Enterprise, as well as Rainbow Chicken Limited products, have been found to be the source of the deadly listeriosis virus, as announced by Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi.
For the past few days, people have mourned the death of the kota, said difficult goodbyes to their favourite snack, and accepted that eating a hot dog will never be the same again.
But, there is a glimmer of hope in the form of the #AddPolonyToAMovieTitle trend that has emerged on Twitter.
And even though listeriosis is definitely not something to laugh about, with 180 deaths confirmed and over 900 cases of listeriosis in South Africa, the trend reflects some relief felt from finally knowing the source of the virus.
We have chosen what we think are some of the best tweets to come from this trend.
