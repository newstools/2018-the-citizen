A trained barn owl hired as the ring-bearer at the wedding of Jenni Arrowsmith and Mark Woods at Peckforton Castle, Cheshire, England on March 17 went rogue and attacked the second best man.
The hilarious incident was captured on video.
After some coaxing, the bird was released by its handler from the back of hall and glided down the aisle with the rings in a pouch attached to its leg as envisaged.
When it landed on the outstretched arm of the first best man, things seemed to be going according to plan, though the bird appeared unsettled and was flapping its wings.
Mayhem followed, however, when the second best man, who was seated nearby, pointed at the owl. The creature took an instant dislike to him. Gasps and shrieks of laughter broke out as the bird launched itself at him and he crashed to the floor with his legs in the air and the owl on his chest.
The owl then flew off and came to rest on the table used for signing the wedding register.
Not phased, the bridal couple joined in the hilarity and once the handler had recovered the owl, the rest of the day continued without incident.
