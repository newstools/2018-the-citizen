“Do not leave anything of value in plain sight. Hide valuables and where possible try and leave it at home,” he said.
Ramoshaba also urged people to report cases like these to the police.
“Think about it this way, when you open a case, police can take fingerprints and collect evidence to build a case. Police can patrol and mark the area as a high risk area and when a suspect is caught he or she can be linked by the evidence to more than one crime. This will make a stronger case and people can be brought to book,” he explained.
Here’s what you need to report when opening a case at the police station:
1. Describe the suspect:
As soon as possible, sit down and write out your description. Include basic information, such as gender, height, age, and race. But also note any distinctive characteristics, such as facial tattoos, deformities, or unusual ways of walking or talking.
2. Write out a description of the property stolen.
Where possible have a picture handy and know the make of cellular phones for example. Also note outstanding features.
3. Leave broken glass, busted doors, and overturned items exactly as you found them.
4. Make sure to fill out the police report or read the report if you did not write it yourself to make sure the information is correct.
5. Make sure to get a case number as soon as possible and follow up regularly to see how the investigation is going.
