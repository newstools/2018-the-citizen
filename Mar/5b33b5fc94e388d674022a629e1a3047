A fourth inmate, who escaped from Pollsmoor Prison, has been rearrested.
Three of the six inmates who escaped from the prison were rearrested earlier today.
The six broke out of the medium B facility on Sunday night at about 11pm. By this evening, four men had already been nabbed during separate operations in Cape Town.
The head of communications at the department of correctional services in the Western Cape, Simphiwe Xako, said it is believed the inmates escaped after removing burglar bars with a piece of metal they allegedly acquired by breaking one of the prison gates.
One of the convicts was serving a sentence for rape and another for attempted murder, robbery and housebreaking.
Xako said members of the department’s emergency support team were working closely with SAPS to ensure the escaped inmates are rearrested.
“The department of correctional services has initiated an internal investigation into the matter in order to establish how the escape took place,” Xako said.
He urged members of the public to refrain from making any contact with any of the six escaped convicts, but to rather alert the police if they had any information about their whereabouts.
This is not the first escape from the correctional facility, as four years ago four prisoners escaped.
