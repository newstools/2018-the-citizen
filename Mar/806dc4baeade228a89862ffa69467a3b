Wits coach Gavin Hunt on Tuesday confirmed the early end to a one-year loan deal, saying: “Amr is a good footballer, but I thought he would settle in much quicker.
“I understand he is joining a Finnish club (HJK Helsinki) on loan and we wish him the best of luck there.”
After a promising start, the goals dried up for the first Egyptian to play for a South African club and recently he could not even make the 18-man matchday squads of the Johannesburg club.
The inactivity led to Gamal being dropped from the Egypt squad for World Cup warm-up matches against Portugal this Friday and Greece next Tuesday.
Back at the World Cup after a 28-year absence, Egypt will compete in Group A with hosts Russia, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay.
Gamal was consistently selected by Egypt as they topped a World Cup qualifying group including Uganda, Ghana and Congo Brazzaville.
The 26-year-old joined the Johannesburg club from record eight-time African title-holders Al Ahly last year, having played for the Cairo outfit against Wits in the CAF Champions League.
