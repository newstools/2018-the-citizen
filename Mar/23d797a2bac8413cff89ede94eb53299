Free foliage table runner
Forego the expensive flowers, and cut foliage from your own garden instead.
Layer the leaves down the middle length of the table, and you have a fresh foliage table runner.
The contrast of the green on a white tablecloth is striking enough, but you could dress it up by popping in a few colourful eggs or Easter-related ornaments you may already have.
Colour hard-boiled eggs
Set an egg cup on each place setting and, instead of a plain boiled egg, pop in a colourful dyed one.
You can colour hard-boiled eggs with food colouring and white vinegar. Click here for instructions.
