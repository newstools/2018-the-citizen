Peddie police in the Eastern Cape are investigating a case of culpable homicide following an accident near Keiskamma Bridge.
Police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender said the accident happened in the early hours of Friday morning and claimed the life of a 33-year-old man.
Govender said an Avanza was travelling from Port Elizabeth to King Williams Town with eight passengers when the vehicle overturned.
“As the vehicle approached the Keiskamma bridge it overturned fatally wounding one passenger, a 33-year-old male. The cause of the accident is not known and will form part of the investigation.”
The name of the deceased will be released once the next of kin has been informed.
Govender urged motorists to exercise caution and adhere to the speed limits. She said there were sections of the N2 that are under construction with an increased amount of traffic.
