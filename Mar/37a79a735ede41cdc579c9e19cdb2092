Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has lived up to her reputation as a political street fighter in her battle with the Democratic Alliance (DA), which will come to a head tomorrow as the party hears charges of misconduct in a closed door disciplinary hearing.Today, she demanded that the inquiry proceed in public, insisting that it was the only way to clear her name after months of mudslinging with the leadership of the country’s main opposition party.De Lille claims that the party is trying to smear her as corrupt.But the move earned another public put down from James Selfe, the chairman of the DA’s federal executive.“Ms De Lille is the one who constantly alleges that she is facing charges of corruption. We have never said so. It is true that there is a simultaneous investigation taking place in the City‚ and depending on its outcome‚ it is possible that further charges will be put to Ms de Lille‚” Selfe said.“It is therefore‚ quite clearly‚ an internal matter between a member and the party. It is of no interest to the general public and has nothing to do with her relationship with the City of Cape Town Council.”The misconduct charges stem from what the DA has termed “a range of extremely serious governance failures” and have been on the table for two months.These include covering up maladministration relating to the loss-making MyCiti Bus service and the planned redevelopment of the city’s foreshore precinct.“Her alleged improper conduct includes, but is not limited to, actively obstructing remedial and disciplinary action being taken for losses from the MyCiti system which at this stage are conservatively estimated at R36 million but could be far greater due to inherent problems with City systems and data preventing precise reconciliations while the Foreshore Freeway Project is potentially worth billions of rands,” the DA said in January.It went on to say it was deeply disturbing that De Lille rounded on officials who blew the whistle on the problems with the bus system and the foreshore bid process.De Lille was seen as embarking on a campaign against the city’s former director for urban catalytic investment Frank Cumming, after he lodged a grievance against Melissa Whitehead, the city’s transport and urban development planning commissioner, over her pressure on the bid committee to favour a particular bid.Cumming has been vindicated by Whitehead’s suspension in January, for covering up fraud and tender irregularities. She could face criminal charges.According to the DA, De Lille personally authorised multiple reports against Graig Kesson, the executive director in the mayoral directorate, after he sought to expose maladministration in the council. The aim of the reports was to prevent a probe into Whitehead and city manager Achmat Ebrahim, who quit when he was asked to answer allegations.Parallel to the investigation into wrongdoing, which resulted in the exit of Ebrahim and Whitehead, was a political investigation, headed by the DA’s chief whip in Parliament John Steenhuisen, into political infighting and mismanagement in the city council under De Lille’s leadership.The tug of war around her tenure is further complicated allegations that she solicited a R5 million bribe from a potential supplier of fire extinguishers. The DA has reported these to the police. De Lille has responded by calling the claims “hogwash”.She has consistently portrayed herself as the victim of a political plot at the hands of “white men” – the cliched portrayal of the party by its political opponents.According to De Lille, whose political roots lie in the Pan Africanist Congress, the DA is trying to oust her for championing a programme of spacial transformation to proliferate low cost housing close to the inner city.It has infuriated the party, with Selfe bluntly terming the claim “nonsense”.But De Lille’s public support among coloured voters on the Cape Flats poses a dilemma for the DA, though her mishandling of the city’s water crisis, including ill-fated plans to impose an infrastructure levy on ratepayers, may have tipped the scales against her.– African News Agency (ANA)For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
