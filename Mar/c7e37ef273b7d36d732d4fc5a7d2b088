“In all instances, we try and negotiate with relevant departments, but we did not get feedback. There are people living on the Valley View land who have already built shacks and permanent structures,” he said.

Jele said there’s a list that’s used to allocate people stands according to their living conditions. “We have been waiting for so long for the government to redistribute land. While the issue of land expropriation is being discussed in parliament we will go ahead and take the land.”

He said while they grab the land without compensation, they do consider the town planning. “We do consider the town planning, which is the reason we first try and negotiate with the relevant departments before moving onto the land.”
MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun said he was aware of the land invasion and the metro police had been deployed to ensure law and order.
“It is one of the many land invasions that took place around the city on the day. It is very concerning. Owners of the land need to take the necessary legal steps to protect the land,” said Sun.
