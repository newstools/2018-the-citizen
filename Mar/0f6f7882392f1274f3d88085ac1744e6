About two weeks ago, a man was found in possession of three water meters.
“We received a panic button alert from a property in Kasteel Street, Lynnwood Glen, at around 15:30,” said Coetzee.
He said a reaction officer was sent to the premises and the resident said he saw a suspect breaking the water meter through his CCTV cameras.
“He gave the officer a description of the suspect.”
The reaction officer then searched for the suspect and found him on the corner of Joseph and Ingersol streets.
“He had three water meters in his possession that he had obviously stolen from properties in the area,” said Coetzee.
The suspect was arrested and handed over to the Brooklyn SAPS.
Coetzee said water meter thieves were after copper components found in the meters. The valuable components were usually sold including the other material on the meter.
He said the theft led to a lot of damage, including extensive water loss, and is usually linked to drug use.
Coetzee advised residents to always be on the look-out for suspicious people.
“Who knows how many more meters this suspect would have got away with. This incident also shows how effective CCTV can be in a residential area.”
