The Hawks this morning conducted a search and seizure raid at the offices of North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo.

Hawks regional spokesperson Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso has confirmed the unit is investigating a case of alleged corruption and fraud within Mahumapelo office.
According to Rikhotso, there are no arrest warrants at this stage.
It’s been widely speculated that the raid is in connection with an IT tender that was awarded to a company called Nepo Data Dynamics, which was allegedly awarded a multimillion-rand three-year contract to help with the province’s IT system.
According to Jacaranda News, documents have been seized from the office of the acting director-general for administration and the department of finance.
News24 reports that Mahumapelo was at a meeting at the North West legislature when the raid took place. However, Hawks investigators did not enter the premier’s office.
The spokesperson for the provincial government, Brian Setswambung, said officials were cooperating with Hawks investigators in effecting their search warrants.
The Hawks are expected to release a statement shortly this afternoon on their raids.
