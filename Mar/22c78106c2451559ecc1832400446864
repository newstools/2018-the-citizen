No sooner had the Proteas levelled the four-match Test series at 1-1 against Australia yesterday, than they were dealt a massive setback with the news that they will do without the services of talisman Kagiso Rabada for the rest of the series.
The 22-year-old speedster bowled South Africa to a six-wicket victory over the visitors on day four of the second Test in Port Elizabeth yesterday, but then was suspended for the remainder of the series after he was found guilty by the International Cricket Council (ICC) of a Level 2 ICC Code of Conduct offence of “inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with a player”.
After dismissing Australian skipper Steve Smith in the first innings, Rabada made contact with his shoulder in his celebrations.
He was also fined and was found guilty of a separate Level 1 offence for giving David Warner a send-off in the second innings.
Proteas skipper Faf du Plessis questioned where Test cricket is going.
“I think we’re going on the sensitive side with everything. Every single incident is on camera … it’s Test cricket,” said Du Plessis. “It’s about KG running in for 15 overs trying to get someone out and when he does, he has to show some passion.”
It begs the question: has Test cricket become too sensitive and is it robbing the game of some of the more colourful characters?
