One of Cyril Ramaphosa’s most noteworthy traits is that he comes across as the voice of reason. He did so during the negotiation process which led to democracy in this country and he did so again in parliament this week, seeking to douse the fires of fear around land expropriation without compensation.Ramaphosa’s clear message when he was answering questions was: don’t panic.The process of land acquisition and redistribution is long and complex and will be thoroughly discussed and debated before it is implemented, the new president promised.He also hit out at “swart gevaar electioneering” – a clear reference to the Democratic Alliance’s alarmist SMS campaign over the weekend of voter registration, in which claims were made that the ANC and the Economic Freedom Fighters were going to seize people’s private houses.“I invite all those who are angry, uncertain and anxious to be part of finding a solution,” said Ramaphosa.However, he was plain that the process had to be guided by the needs of the poor.It was reasonable, it was optimistic, some may even say it was statesman-like.Because the reality is that the land issue cannot be swept under the carpet yet again.Sooner or later, that carpet – and the entire house – are going to be set alight by the anger of the majority of the population.But, Ramaphosa was saying that his ANC does not intend to have two wrongs equal a right by imposing land grabs in reverse.And that is something which should quell nerves.It should also be kept in mind that, amid all the politicking – and we have been overdosed on it by the likes of Julius Malema – nothing concrete has yet been produced … and nothing will be without long and involved bargaining.Now is the time to put our trust in you, Mr President.Do not let us down. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
