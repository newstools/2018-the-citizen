The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) yesterday condemned the suspension of Metrorail services in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria, and called for the reinstatement of services, saying the suspension would result in people losing their jobs.PAC spokesperson Kenneth Mokgatlhe said they were embarrassed and disappointed to learn that employees of Metrorail/Prasa were assaulted on duty by criminals.It was clear, he added, that Metrorail did not have viable mechanisms in place to provide a safe environment for employees.“It is also clear that they only care about making money from poor people without prioritising an excellent, safe environment for their staff and, above all, their passengers who are supposed to be primary stakeholders,” Mokgatlhe said.Metrorail has temporarily suspended the Mamelodi train services following train hijackings and attacks on more than 10 of its employees in less than a week. All these incidents occurred in the Mamelodi Corridor.Lillian Mofokeng, Metrorail spokesperson, said the 10 assault victims were withdrawn from operations. In addition, more than six trains have been withdrawn from service due to malicious damage to property.Directing his attention to Police Minister Bheki Cele, Mokgatlhe said the PAC was worried about Cele’s inability to deal with the growing crime problem.“It is so rife that it’s even committed by police officers who are supposed to protect us. This Bheki Cele is only different to Fikile Mbalula because he does not have a Twitter account to make noise there.”For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter
