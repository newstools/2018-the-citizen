Financial education is important. The cost of living continues to rise; SA has a dismal savings rate and many households are drowning in debt. This all leads to poor financial and retirement planning and the fact that only one in six South Africans can maintain their lifestyle after retirement.
In The Citizen’s Business section, we target those struggling to keep their heads above water. Financial planning is not rocket science, but it is important to understand the basic principles of investments, and that is what we set out to do.
The Citizen’s bumper Personal Finance feature on a Monday is a comprehensive offering to assist readers to plan for their future. It covers a range of topics related to how to manage the money in your wallet and to establish a proper financial-planning process. Topics include how to view property investments, how to budget properly, how to plan for retirement, recent trends in investments, how to pay less tax and how to insure your assets – especially the most important asset you have: your ability to generate an income.
