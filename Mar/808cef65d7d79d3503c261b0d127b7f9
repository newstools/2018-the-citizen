One person was killed and seven others were injured when a bakkie rolled on the corner of Edwards Avenue and the R28 in Westonaria on the West Rand early on Saturday morning, paramedics said.
When ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene shortly before 6am, a man was found lying a few metres from the bakkie, ER24 spokeswoman Ineke van Huyssteen said.
“Unfortunately, the man had sustained fatal injuries and was declared dead on the scene. Upon further assessment, paramedics found seven patients who had sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. One of the patients later refused transportation to hospital.”
ER24, as well as provincial EMS, transported the patients to hospital for further medical care. The circumstances surrounding the accident were not yet known, Van Huyssteen said.
