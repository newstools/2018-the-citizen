According to police spokesperson, Lt Col Moatshe Ngoepe, a 76-year-old woman’s body was found floating in the Nandoni dam on Friday. Her body was surrounded by crocodiles.
Ngoepe says police had to throw stones to scare the reptiles away and her body was then retrieved. Preliminary investigations revealed that flesh from both hands, legs as well as stomach were eaten by the crocodiles.
Meanwhile, a nine-year-old boy was caught and killed by a crocodile in the Mutale River Tswera on Sunday.
A group of boys were swimming in the river when a crocodile caught him. The other boys rushed to the village to inform the elders who responded immediately. Upon their arrival they found the boy’s lifeless body floating in the water and informed the police.
Ngoepe concluded by saying that investigations into both matters continue.
