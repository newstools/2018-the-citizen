Thirteen people were injured, some seriously, when two bakkies collided head-on on the D188 at Hela-Hela in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands on Saturday afternoon.
ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find the two smashed bakkies in the middle of the gravel road. The occupants were still trying to climb out of both bakkies, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said.
“Paramedics began to assess the patients, finding that 13 people had sustained injuries ranging from minor to serious.”
The patients were treated for their injuries and the seriously injured provided with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, one of the seriously injured patients was airlifted by the AMS medical helicopter to a nearby hospital. The remaining patients were transported by ambulance to various hospitals for further treatment.
The details surrounding this accident were not yet known, Meiring said.
