They don’t need money, because we provide them with food every day.”He said there were various feeding schemes catering for beggars in Pretoria.“These include our mobile distribution and fixed daily distribution points.”He said money given to beggars helped them to keep their business going.“They are not just drug users, they are the distributors as well. They sell drugs to children on the street.”Smith urged Centurions to rather buy beggars meal vouchers “instead of giving them money”.Kempton Park homeless man lands a job<iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://citizen.co.za/news/news-cns/1806799/kempton-park-homeless-man-lands-a-job/embed/#?secret=wQ3ubuqbVs" data-secret="wQ3ubuqbVs" width="500" height="282" title="&#8220;Kempton Park homeless man lands a job&#8221; &#8212; The Citizen" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
