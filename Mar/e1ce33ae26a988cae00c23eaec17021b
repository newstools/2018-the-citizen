The suspects then began to ransack the house, insisting on cash and the safe key. 
A struggle ensued between Breedt and one of the suspects, in which Breedt was stabbed eight times, after which the suspects promptly left. 
With the help of surrounding farmers, the Heritage Protection Group (HPG), Mpumalanga SAPS and personnel of the DLU ambulance were able to stabilise Breedt, transporting him to a hospital in Mkopane, where he will receive treatment.
HPG positively identified DNA on the scene, which could form part of a large-scale follow up investigation. 
Farmers from the Roedtan area, under the leaders of security guards of Potgietersrus DLU closed roads for the investigation. 
Heavy rain forced the investigation to conclude around 21:00 on Thursday night. 
Johan de Beer, head of security at Potgietersrus DLU, strongly condemned the attack. 
De Beer is involved in organised construction and farm safety infrastructure. 
He expressed his gratitude towards HPG, farmers, the community and SAPS, who responded so quickly.
