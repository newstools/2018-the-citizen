The City of Cape Town has increased law enforcement visibility in Gugulethu, Nyanga and Philippi East after a series of violent protests since Tuesday.
Cape Town mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said the protests continued until the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Gugulethu Post Office was set alight and severely damaged, and dustbins outside the police station were also set on fire.
Unrest was recorded in all three informal settlements, as well as on the N2 between the R300 and Borcherd’s Quarry.
Smith said small groups of people set alight tyres and other debris in the “hit and run” acts.
“While it is not entirely clear what is behind the flare-up in protest action, the City can confirm that its Anti-Land Invasion Unit held an operation in Gugulethu and Nyanga yesterday morning, where pegs and structures linked to persistent land invasion attempts in recent weeks were removed.
“We are working closely with the South African Police Service and have established a Joint Operations Centre to coordinate our operations to quell the violence and wanton acts of destruction.”
