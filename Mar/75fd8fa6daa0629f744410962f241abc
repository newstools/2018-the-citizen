According to one of the students, Bongani Malaza, students ate food that was prepared by the service provider and suddenly became sick.

“We want the department to remove the service provider because they have failed to do their duties. The kitchen is not as clean as it should be, and the food is even worse. We don’t understand why this service provider continues to provide services in our college,” he said.



Tests were done when the students were hospitalised to determine the cause.

“They took stool tests, and we want those tests so that it can be revealed that indeed it was the food we ate. We want them to come and explain to us why they never came to address us,” he explained.
