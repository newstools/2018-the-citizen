Two men charged with the execution style murder of 12-year-old Aliya “Angel” Tee were back in the Port Elizabeth High Court yesterday, but the trial could not continue because one of them is too ill.
Tee, a Grade 7 pupil and prefect at Strelitzia Primary School in Port Elizabeth, was killed in June 2016, when gunmen posing as police officers forced open the back door of her Barberry Street home in Bethelsdorp.
Nealon Redhouse, 18, and Deon Harmse, 24, are charged with Tee’s murder and the attempted murder of her parents. Other charges against them are housebreaking with intent to commit murder and unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition.
The case was previously postponed to determine Harmse’s medical condition. He has been diagnosed with tuberculosis and still has a drain attached to his body, the court heard yesterday.
The court also heard that one of his lungs had collapsed. State Advocate Mujaahid Sandan said Harmse’s operation has been booked for April 16, and asked the court to postpone the matter to ascertain how much time he would need to recover.
The case was postponed until April 17.
