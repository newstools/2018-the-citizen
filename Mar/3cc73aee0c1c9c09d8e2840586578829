A 41-year-old woman has been admitted to hospital in Pietermaritzburg after apparently accidentally shooting herself in the stomach on Saturday evening, paramedics said.
Netcare 911 responded at about 6.30pm to reports of a shooting at a residence in Chasedene road, Chase Valley, Pietermaritzburg, Netcare 911 spokesman Shawn Herbst said.
“Although reports from the scene are speculative, it is alleged that the 41-year-old female was shot in the abdomen while apparently cleaning a handgun in preparation for a shooting competition.”
The woman was treated on the scene by a Netcare 911 advanced life support paramedic and transported to a local hospital for further assessment and care. Police were on the scene and would investigate, Herbst said.
