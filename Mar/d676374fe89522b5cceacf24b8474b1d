The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises has announced that it agreed to summon former South African Airways board chairperson Dudu Myeni; former president Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane; and the Gupta brothers as it investigates the mismanagement of state funds at state-owned enterprises.
Inquiry chairperson, Zukiswa Rantho, said Myeni had been invited by the committee twice and had indicated that she was unable to appear before the committee on both occasions.
“Members of the committee said they will not be held to ransom by Ms Myeni as it is in her best interest to appear before the inquiry. The committee has not received a sick note from Ms Myeni,” Rantho said in a statement.
“Members of the committee proposed an independent evaluation to verify if she is indeed sick. The committee is of the view that it would be impossible to finish the work of the inquiry without the testimony of Ms Myeni including that of Mr Zuma and the Gupta family.”
Rantho said issuing of summons was the last resort that the committee had to undertake as invitations have been issued without any success.
The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises is probing governance failures at state-owned enterprises.
