A house robbery suspect recently became the victim of a vigilante attack in Dukuduku near Mtubatuba when he was brutally tortured for his alleged crime.
His feet were so badly beaten he could not walk and, when taken to hospital for treatment, doctors were forced to amputate his toes.
He was hospitalised under police guard and is yet to appear in court.
This incident is one of many similar cases reported in the area and has led to police issuing a stern warning against communities taking the law into their own hands.
‘This kind of behaviour is illegal and we do not tolerate such actions,’ said Mtubatuba SAPS Communications Officer, Captain Justice Hlabisa.
