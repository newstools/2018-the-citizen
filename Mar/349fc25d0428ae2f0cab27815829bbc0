Amendments made by President Cyril Ramaphosa to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture regulations will unlock critical evidence needed for the successful prosecution of those who have looted state resources, the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) said.
On Friday, the presidency announced that on the basis of legal advice, Ramaphosa had amended regulation 8(2) to limit the inadmissibility of evidence to circumstances where witnesses may incriminate themselves.
The regulation now reads: “A self-incriminating answer or a statement given by a witness before the commission shall not be admissible as evidence against that person in any criminal proceedings brought against that person instituted in any court, except in criminal proceedings where the person concerned is charged with an offence in terms of section 6 of the Commissions Act, 1947 (Act No. 8 of 1947).”
Sanco national spokesman Jabu Mahlangu called for investigations into state capture to be streamlined. “Processes which have thus far been used for showboating and political posturing must be abandoned and issues that fall within the mandate and terms of the commission referred to it without further delay for in-depth investigation,” he said.
“While we are encouraged by the recent interest shown by law enforcement agencies to tackle fraud and corruption, case progress on damning allegations they are probing must be closely monitored and evaluated to ensure that these are purposeful and without pretense.”
State institutions weakened by indecision and poor leadership during the era of former president Jacob Zuma should be strengthened to enable them to fulfill their constitutional mandate. “Critical appointments must be expedited to reposition them for administrative justice and efficiency,” Mahlangu said.
