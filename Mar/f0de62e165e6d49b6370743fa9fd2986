Former PSL referee Ace Ncobo claims that he has been reliably informed that at least three more women will lay charges soon against South African Football Association (Safa) boss Danny Jordaan.
This comes after musician and former ANC MP, Jennifer Ferguson, laid formal rape charges against the football administrator in Johannesburg last week.
In October 2017 Ferguson, who is a singer and now lives in Sweden, claimed that the sports boss raped her at a beachfront hotel in Nelson Mandela Bay after a function where she performed in 1993.
Taking to Twitter on Friday, Ncobo tweeted: “I’m reliably informed that at least three more will lay charges soon.”


In a Twitter rant against Jordaan, Ncobo also accused the Safa president of being a dictator after he was blocked from Safa’s official account.






Safa said at a press conference in Johannesburg on Thursday, Jordaan was innocent until proven guilty. The association announced that its National Executive Committee will support Jordaan in the rape allegations laid against him.
Jordaan must resign
Ncobo, who succeeded in forcing the cancellation of Safa’s elective congress, told the SABC this week that Jordaan must do the honourable thing and resign from his position for the sake of preserving the good image of football in the country.
The former school principal added that he would go all out to garner support from women within football to force Jordaan out.
Ncobo said he will also be approaching Safa sponsors, who will not want to be associated with a leader who is facing serious charges.
