Market research company Plus 94 Research said on Tuesday it was tweaking its annual index on top companies in the country to focus on the creation of workplace environments conducive not only for the employer, but also the worker.
Plus 94 Research, which as conducted, compiled and published the Top Companies Reputation Index for the last eight years, said the latest edition, in partnership with Independent Media, would shift focus of the research “from a niche perspective focused on the premium reader to a more inclusive market profile”.
“We want to look at a more complete view in measuring those companies that are creating employment, contributing towards holistic transformation focused on improving the livelihoods of people, living conditions, standard and quality of life; and playing a broader role towards the overall global competitiveness of the South African economy,” said Plus 94 Research chief executive Sifiso Falala.
“Top Companies South Africa will also zoom in on leadership, as we have seen that we cannot isolate individual behaviour from global competitive ratings.”
The survey will measure companies and organisations on products and services, vision and leadership, workplace environment, broad-based black economic empowerment,  corporate social responsibility,  financial performance and governance. It will sample 180 entities, up from 171 last year, and 2,600 respondents.
“We trust that the study and its results will continue to applaud and reward those companies that are working hard to ensure that they stay on top of their game, and inspire poor performing companies to do better,”  said Mike Ntsasa, group executive for the business and public sector at Independent M
