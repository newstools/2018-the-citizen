In the wake of Orlando Pirates’ 3-1 drubbing of Kaizer Chiefs in the weekend’s Soweto derby, fans are once again speculating that muti rituals were probably involved.
An old video is circulating showing a team member emptying his pockets of a strange substance in one of the goal mouths.
Take a look below:


Last year, a book on the life of Teko Modise offered some bizarre insight into the alleged muti rituals performed at Pirates.




The biography‚ The Curse of Teko Modise‚ offered details of midnight baths with specially prepared concoctions, jumping back and forth over a stick and other rituals, which apparently troubled the more religious members of the team.
Modise claims that when he arrived at Pirates he met their resident sangoma.
He played for Pirates between 2007 and 2011 and related in his book that when the muti was unsuccessful, the sangoma apparently felt the problem was not his muti but that the players weren’t using it properly.
So he allegedly at one point stopped allowing them to wash off the muti from their baths, forcing them to go and play with the “itchy” substance still on.
