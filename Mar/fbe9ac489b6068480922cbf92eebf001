It is startling to think that in this day and age a near-exclusive “club” still exists – albeit thousands of metres in the air.
Figures from the Civil Aviation Authority show there are just 17 black women holders of the sector’s top qualification – the airline transport pilot’s licence – out of a total of 3 839 across the country.
And, there is just one black female holder of the same licence for a helicopter.
Why are we are not seeing more women – particularly black women – qualifying to fly commercial aircraft?
It is certainly not because of a lack of talent. Women have been successfully flying aircraft since early in the previous century, battling nature as well as the hostility of men, many of whom felt at the time that a woman’s place was in the kitchen.
There is no scientific study which proves men are more adept at handling machinery than women.
Indeed, the insurance industry reckons women are a lower risk than men when handling more commonplace machines, like cars.
The aviation industry needs to transform but, at the same time, government and society as a whole has to encourage the young black girls to reach for the sky.
