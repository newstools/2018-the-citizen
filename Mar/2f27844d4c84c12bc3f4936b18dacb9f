Residents cutting down protected trees in Centurion will soon face censure, Centurion Rekord reports.
The Tshwane metro is investigating the cutting down of 13 trees with an estimated value of R60 000 each, according to local councillor Cindy Billson.

Billson said most trees on the pavement were regularly pruned by the metro, but “if residents experience difficulty with these trees, it is best to inform the metro”.
She warned that residents might be held liable for fines if they cut these trees without authorisation from the metro.
“The pavement is municipal grounds and the municipality’s responsibility so the correct procedure to cut them needs to be followed.”
Residents complained recently when a supposed 120-year-old tree was felled at a farm in Irene, said Billson.
According to law, trees older than 100 years are protected and may not be cut.
The complainants told Centurion Rekord that the old tree had a long history in the area.
“Lots of children’s parties and weddings were held under this tree,” one reader wrote to Rekord.
“It is a shame that the farm owner brought it down.”
An enquiry was sent to the Tshwane metro on 26 February, but no response has been received yet.
