Volkswagen has finally taken the wraps off its third-gen Touareg SUV in Beijing.
.
Based on the MLB Evo platform that underpins the Audi Q7, Porsche Cayenne, Bentley Bentayga and the soon-to-come Lamborghini Urus, the SA-bound Touareg is said to have lost some weight.
Volkswagen says it is now 106kg lighter than the outgoing model.
It has grown in dimensions too. It is 4 878 mm long – 77 mm longer than its predecessor. It is 44 mm wider than before while its roof is 7mm closer to the ground at 1 702mm.
With the rear seats in place, VW claims luggage capacity of 810 litres, which is 113 litres more than the second-generation model.

The interior boasts VW’s new Innovision Cockpit, which links a centrally mounted 15-inch infotainment touchscreen with the brand’s familiar 12-inch digital instrument cluster.
In terms of engine derivatives, there is a 3.0-litre V6 turbodiesel in two states of tune, 170 kW and 210 kW and a 250 kW 3.0-litre V6 petrol.
Volkswagen says it might bring a 4.0-litre V8 turbodiesel with 310 kW and a plugin hybrid with 270 kW.
