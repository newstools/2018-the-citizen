The highly-anticipated equipment “currently is undergoing final integration and test phases that will require more time to ensure a successful mission,” NASA said in a statement. The launch had been postponed once before to 2019.
“Once a new launch readiness date is determined, NASA will provide a cost estimate that may exceed the projected $8 billion development cost,” NASA said, without further clarifying the potential final cost of the project.
The James Webb Space Telescope — named after NASA’s second administrator, in office from 1961 to 1968 — will be the most powerful telescope ever built.
One hundred times more sensitive than its predecessor — the revolutionary Hubble Space Telescope Hubble launched in 1990 — it will be capable of studying the atmosphere of exoplanets located beyond our solar system.
