Another of the suspects linked to the infamous Seven Angels church at the centre of a deadly attack on a police station in which five police officers and an off-duty army officer was killed has abandoned his bail application.
Phuthumile Mancoba, one of the church leaders, appeared in the Ngcobo Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday.
He had earlier indicated his request for bail to the court through his legal aid attorney. However, on Wednesday, Mancoba told the court that he does not require bail any longer.
Mancoba and 11 co-accused are facing a charge of conspiracy to commit robbery with aggravating circumstances. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has indicated that it will add the charge of robbery at their next court appearance.
A 12th suspect, Zukile Nkanunu, 23, appeared alongside Mancoba at the Ngcobo Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday after he was arrested by the task team investigating the police station killings last month.
Nkanunu, like most of the suspects arrested in connection with attack, said he does not require bail and will conduct his own defence. All 12 remain in custody and will reappear at the Ngcobo Magistrate’s Court on the 30 April.
Police raided the Seven Angels Church in the aftermath of the attack, initially arresting 10 suspects, while seven others died during a shoot-out with police and three were admitted to hospital.
