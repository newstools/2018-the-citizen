Many South Africans have slammed the report, saying it supports an agenda that seeks to portray white South African farmers as an oppressed group.
While farm murders are a reality in SA, there is much debate as to whether they are targeted and racially motivated or just an example of the criminality that plagues the lives of all South Africans.


Afriforum’s Ernst Roets and Kallie Kriel are at the forefront of lobbying for support for white farmers in South Africa and for promoting the agenda that they are targeted because of their race. The two toured the US in May and the UK in 2017.
They have been accused by some of spreading falsehoods about South Africa and discouraging much-needed investment. Their narrative has gained support among members of the US, UK and Australian right, including Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton, UK media personality Katie Hopkins and former Grand Wizard of the Klu Klux Klan, David Duke.
AgriSA released stats last week indicating that farm murders are at their lowest in 20 years. AfriForum has rejected these statistics, saying their own stats indicate that these murders are in fact on the rise.

There have been several stories in the UK media about the plight of white South Africans that many have slammed, saying they do not reflect the actual situation here.
A 2016 UK Mail Online article claimed that more than 400 000 white South Africans live in poverty. A report by AfricaCheck debunked this, saying that national data suggests that the number is less than a quarter of that.
