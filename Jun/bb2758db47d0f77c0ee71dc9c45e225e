Incredible footage has emerged of a desperate fight by villagers in Thailand to rescue a dog wagging its tail while in the grip of a giant python.

At one stage the dog seems to have lost the struggle, but the men donâ€™t give up and keep beating the snake with sticks.
Eventually one tries pulling the tail and, as the python releases its grip, the dog runs off remarkably unscathed.
