The trial against eight men accused of the murder of Sabata Petros Chale in Marikana near Rustenburg is expected to continue in the North West High Court in Mogwase on Tuesday.
On Monday, three of the men told the court that Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillor in Marikana, Phillip Mntombi, convened a meeting at the Marikana police station before 39-year-old Chale was hacked to death.
This was after the police allegedly fired shots at residents in Marikana West RDP also known as Khabangena.
Aubrey Seitsang, Sibonile Sobopha and Herbert Baqhesi told the court that they went to the Marikana police station on December 8, 2016, after Mntombi used a loud speaker ordering people to gather at the police station.
