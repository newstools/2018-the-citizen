Trade unions today said it presented a consolidated wage proposal to Eskom as talks resumed for a second day at South Africa’s power utility.
In a joint statement from the National Union of Mineworkers, (NUM), the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and Solidarity, the unions said they debated Eskom’s proposed four-year wage agreement in which the utility is offering a 4.7 percent increase and inflation based increases for the years following.
“We met with Eskom management and as the trade unions we consolidated our positions and presented our comprehensive demands to Eskom,” the statement said.
“We believe that if Eskom accepts our proposal it will rescue Eskom from the financial crisis it finds itself in, whilst also dealing with the wage demands our members have made.”
The unions would not divulge details of the offer, saying it was a “delicate process” which should not be negotiated in the media.
“On Thursday, we hope that Eskom will give us feedback on the proposal we made jointly as all unions. If they give us positive feedback to our proposal, we may be able to take it back to our members for them to make the final decision on whether to accept the offer or not.”
