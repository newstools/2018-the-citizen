Two men were on Tuesday found guilty for the execution-style murder of 12-year-old Aliya ‘Angel’ Tee in the Port Elizabeth High Court.
Tee, 12, was killed in June 2016 when gunmen, posing as police officers, forced open the backdoor of her Barberry Street home in Bethelsdorp.
Judge Mandela Makaula found Nealon Redhouse, 18, and Deon Harmse, 24, guilty for the attempted murder of Angel’s parents Candice and Edmund Tee.
The pair were also convicted on a charge related to them impersonating police members and housebreaking with intent to commit murder.
Redhouse was also found guilty of possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition.
Makaula found that Angel’s parents were credible witnesses who did not contradict one another.
“Their demeanour was impeccable. They excelled in reliving the event, and the trauma they suffered did not affect their ability to tell what had happened that night.”
“It is clear to me that when the accused left, they thought they had killed everybody,” said Makaula.
Tee was a Grade 7 pupil and prefect at Strelitzia Primary School in Port Elizabeth’s Northern Areas.
Tee’s father, Edmund, was shot and incapacitated while trying to fend off the attackers.
After the men shot Edmund Tee, they proceeded to look for other family members in the home.
Tee and her mother, Candice, were in the bathroom when they were discovered by the gunmen.
After pleading with the men not to shoot, the schoolgirl was shot execution-style in the head.
Her mother survived the tragic incident and passed out during the shooting. She later regained consciousness to discover her daughter’s lifeless body covered in blood.
The case was postponed until July 26 for sentencing proceedings.
