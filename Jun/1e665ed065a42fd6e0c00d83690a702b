On Friday night power utility Eskom announced load shedding was being suspended countrywide.
It had been forced to implement level one load shedding, the least serious, on Thursday night and throughout Friday, which it claimed was caused by a worker strike and sabotage.
However, the threat of load shedding remains, as the grid is likely to be placed under heavy pressure with a cold front sweeping through the country and hitting Gauteng over the weekend.


The full load-shedding schedule is available on Eskom’s website for direct customers. Municipal customers need to consult their city or town’s website.
