“Mala Mala is South Africa’s most expensive land deal to date and has cost taxpayers R1,1 billion,” Robertson said in a statement.
“Both the Land Claims Court and High Court ruled that the price envisioned for Mala Mala was excessive and not in the best interests of South Africans.”
Robertson explained that a report presented to the committee could not explain why the state originally opposed the proposed amount of R751 737 million, but finally settled on the increased amount outside the courts.
