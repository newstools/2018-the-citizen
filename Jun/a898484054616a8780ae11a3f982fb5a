The V&A Waterfront’s innovative Silo District won big at the 2018 South African Property Owners Association (SAPOA) awards for Innovative Excellence, scooping a total of six awards, including three coveted ‘Best Overall’ awards.
The SAPOA awards were held in Durban from 19 to 21 June, and the Silo District won the prestigious Best Overall Building, Best Overall Heritage Building and Best Overall Refurbishment Awards for the Grain Silo conversion to the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Mocaa).
The property also won the Best Mixed Use Development and Best Green Development Awards for the overall Silo District and Best Other Development Award for the Radisson Red Hotel.
The primary objective of the awards is to define excellence in the property industry and become a benchmark for excellence in the industry. It also aims to provide public recognition for top quality design and functionality. Judges looked for commercial viability, aesthetic appeal, innovative design, efficient functionality and environmental sustainability.
The awards are considered the most prestigious of their kind within the South African commercial real estate industry.
