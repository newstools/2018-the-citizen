A woman heroically saved an 8-month-old baby from the scene of an accident that killed five people in Namibia recently.
The woman, Tulonga Neputa, saw the baby lying on the road as she was driving past the scene of the accident on June 7.
Neputa was travelling from the Windhoek-Okahandja road towards Swakopmund when she and the group she was travelling with came across an accident that had just happened.
A BMW sedan and an Amarok bakkie collided head-on, killing four people instantly, while the fifth person died while being transported to hospital.
It was Neputa’s quick thinking that may have saved the baby’s life.
She ran towards the crash after stopping the driver of the vehicle she was travelling in.
According to reports, the baby was found crying with a broken arm when Neputa found him.
The baby was travelling with his grandfather, according to a post by the baby’s mother.
The baby was the sole survivor, and was handed to medics on the scene.
Screams from the video can be heard as someone tells Neputa to hurry before the vehicle explodes.
The mother of the baby boy wrote a statement on her Facebook page thanking her baby’s saviour.
Neputa has received praise, yet the mother of two boys said she was not a hero but only a parent whose motherly instincts kicked in.
