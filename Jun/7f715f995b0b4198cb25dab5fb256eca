The funeral of Luyanda Tshabalala, the Fred Norman Secondary School learner from Johannesburg who was “accidentally” shot by his father on Tuesday night, took place this Saturday morning.
Luyanda’s classmates could not contain their grief during the funeral proceedings as they spoke about their loss of a peer they admired for his gifts, especially mathematics, eNCA reports.
The late pupil was known as a top academic achiever who possessed good leadership skills, having held the deputy position on the student council.
His father, Sibusiso Emanuel Tshabalala, was able to attend the funeral after he was released when he pleaded with the court to bury his child.
On Tuesday, June 5, Sibusiso Tshabalala, 51, was sleeping in his vehicle while waiting for his son, Luyanda, at evening classes after school.
He explained to the court that he fell asleep in his car and was woken up by a loud noise and tampering with the car, which was when he thought he was being hijacked, and he drew his firearm and shot, only to hear his son screaming: “Daddy, it’s me!”
He said it was dark outside, and wasn’t able to see that it was his son.
Tshabalala handed himself over to the police following the incident.
