The Department of Energy (DoE) has announced that the fuel price is set to rise by 82 cents a litre and diesel will cost between 85 and 87c/l more from 6 June.
This means that in Gauteng, a litre of 93 petrol will cost R15,54 from next Wednesday
The wholesale price of illuminating paraffin will rise by 82c/l, while the retail price of LPG will increase by 138c/kg.
The DoE ascribed the huge spike in fuel prices to a weaker rand and higher global oil prices.
“The average rand/US dollar exchange rate for the period April 25, 2018 to May 31, 2018 was R12.5099 compared to R11.9797 during the previous period.
“This led to a higher contribution to the Basic Fuel Prices on petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 30.46 c/l, 31.17 c/l and 31.53 c/l respectively.”
The latest hike has taken the per litre price of petrol into record territory, with motorists now having to fork out R15.20 and R15.79 for a litre of 95 octane unleaded petrol on the coast and inland respectively.
