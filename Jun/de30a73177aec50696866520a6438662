Ivory Park SAPS detectives have arrested an Olifantsfontein police reservist for corruption after she allegedly swindled three people out of R7 000 each with the promise of a job, Tembisan reports.
The 47-year-old, who also used to work as a reservist at the Ivory Park SAPS, is alleged to have promised her victims nonexistent jobs at the three Gauteng metro police departments.

According to Ivory Park SAPS spokesperson Captain Bernard Matimulane, so far three people have already identified her as the person who tricked them into believing she had connections within the police.
“Because she was known to them, and was at times seen performing police work in police uniform, the victims fell for her tricks. She has allegedly been paid R7 000 by each of the victims.
“Once they realised that the promised jobs are not materialising, the victims began to open cases. The first victim was conned in March this year. Ivory Park policing are appealing to any member of the public who has been defrauded under similar circumstances to come forward and open a case as they are willing to ensure that anyone involved in this scheme faces the full might of the law,” Matimulane said.
The station commander of the Ivory Park SAPS, Brigadier David Mbongeni Ngcobo, has cautioned members of the public against the tendency of buying jobs.
“Jobs are not for sale and anyone involved in these things is committing a crime,” said Ngcobo.
He has expressed his disappointment that despite the fact that application forms have a not-for-sale sign, people still fall for the tricks.
Ivory Park police are prepared to investigate this matter and to arrest any additional person if evidence emerges that there are still others involved, Ngcobo emphasised.
