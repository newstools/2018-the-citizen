A suspected church robber is still at large but two of his accomplishes were handed hefty sentences at the Rustenburg Regional Court, North West police said today.
Captain Elsabe Augoustides said Molefe Lehole, 22, and Thabiso Innocent Rankhasa, 32, were sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for armed robbery with aggravating circumstances on June 14.
The two and a third man robbed churchgoers at gunpoint during a church service on March 19, 2017.
During the robbery, four women between the ages of 17 and 58 sustained flesh wounds.
The robbers fled on foot with cell phones, jewellery, watches, rings, handbags, cash and the video camera of the church, valued at almost R200 000 in total.
Some members of the church chased the men and managed to overpower one of them, the police were called and he was arrested. The two others were arrested in Extension 13, Boitekong on the same day.
Captain Augoustides said two weeks later, two of the firearms used in the robbery were seized by the police.
One of the 9mm pistols had previously been robbed from a security official. The serial number of the second handgun was filed off.
Most of the belongings that were robbed from the congregants were recovered.
“The police are still looking for the third accused, Kodisang Mohajane, 23, [who] escaped from lawful custody.”
