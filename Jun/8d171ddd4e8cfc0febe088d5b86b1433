One person is reported to be dead while relative calm has returned to the scene of this morning’s Wild West taxi shootout in the lower Pietermaritzburg CBD in KwaZulu-Natal, the Maritzburg Public Eye reports.
Police and forensics are at the scene of this morning’s bloody taxi violence shootout that has thus far claimed the life of one person and left several others injured.
SAPS spokesperson Captain Khosi Khonjelwayo confirmed the person who was shot was a bystander and not involved in the taxi industry, while another person, who was shot in his leg, drove off in a taxi.
Police are investigating one count of murder.
NT Dhlomo, member of the Pietermaritzburg Long-Distance Taxi Association (PLDTA) said there has been ongoing problems in the past year between the PLDTA and the Howick Taxi Association that boiled over today.
“We have permits to operate in Pietermaritzburg and Howick, while others do not. We don’t have a problem with any other taxi association in Pmb besides the Howick guys,” Dhlomo said.
