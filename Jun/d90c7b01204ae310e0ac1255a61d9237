On Monday the Cape of Good Hope SPCA was alerted to a video that depicted the horrific beating and stabbing of a baby seal.
The perpetrator who is shown in the video, named as Marius Tredoux, has been trending on social media, particularly Facebook, ever since – with general outrage at the callousness and bloodlust he displays in the footage.
The SPCA has reacted with outrage and called for the public’s support.
An example of someone on Facebook calling for a campaign against Marius Tredoux.
“We, as were many members of the public who saw the video on social media, were sickened at this blatant display of cruelty,” said a statement by the SABC.
Through the cooperation of South African citizens, the organisation was able to identify the two men in the video who were shown beating, stabbing, and torturing the baby seal while laughing.
“As a result we have been able to gather enough evidence to lay charges in terms of the Animal Protection Act 71 of 1962 against Marius Tredoux, who is the man seen on the video abusing the seal. Charges have also been laid against Rynard van der Heever, who filmed the appalling scene. The charges against Marius Tredoux are obvious as he can be seen beating and hitting the baby seal, However, Rynard van der Heever is as guilty in terms of the Act as he did nothing to stop the violent abuse.”
Members of the public were urged to help build the case against the abusers.
“We are confident that justice will be served. In a further bid to strengthen our case we ask that members of the public go to their local police station and make a statement (signed and stamped by the police) that requests of the court that the highest possible penalty is imposed at sentencing. It is imperative that this original copy is then posted to us for use during proceedings.” (see details below)




“Help us get justice for this poor animal. We do not know what the fate of the seal was as it seems that the scene was filmed in December 2017.”
