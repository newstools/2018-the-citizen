A truck transporting live chickens was looted and five people were arrested in Koster today, following fresh protest action in the small farming town west of Rustenburg, North West police said.
Spokesperson Sergeant Ofentse Mokgadi said fresh protests erupted on Wednesday night, after five people were arrested in connection with last month’s service delivery protests in which Kgetlengrivier mayor Kim Medupe’s house, her guesthouse and another building she rented out were torched, along with the house of a councillor. Six cars were also set alight.
“Five people were arrested last night [Wednesday], the community regrouped and closed the R509 road between Koster and Swartruggens as well as the R52 road between Koster and Rustenburg, demanding the released of the five people,” he said.
The five appeared in the Koster Magistrate’s Court today. Three of them were released on R1 000 bail each and charges were withdrawn against two others. They were charged with public violence.
“Live chickens were looted from a truck in the morning, five people were arrested and the looted chickens were recovered,” he said.
The five are expected to appear in the Koster Magistrate’s Court tomorrow, facing charges of public violence and possession of suspected stolen property.
The road were stilled barricaded with rocks this afternoon, and police were monitoring the situation.
