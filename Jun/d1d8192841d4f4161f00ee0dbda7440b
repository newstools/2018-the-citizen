The man who raped and murdered a five-year-old girl after he fell out with her grandmother just over a year ago, was handed three life sentences in the Western Cape High Court in Cape Town today, Western Cape police said.
Minentle Lekhakha went missing while playing outside her home in Strand on June 3 last year. Xolani Lantu, 35, was arrested shortly after her body was found.
“Minentle’s grandmother, Thelma Bombela, 51, broke off her relationship with Lantu due to him becoming verbally abusive, and little Minentle had to pay for this with her life,” a statement from police said.
“Her body was found under a bridge along Broadway Soek Street in the Nomzamo area of Strand and it was established that she had been raped prior to being murdered.”
Western Cape provincial police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula welcomed the sentence handed down to Lantu and congratulated the investigating team for their work in ensuring justice for Minentle.
