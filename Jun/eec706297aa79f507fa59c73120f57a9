The Minerals Council South Africa, formerly known as the Chamber of Mines, on Friday signed a water conservation and demand management agreement with the department of water and sanitation aimed at driving saving and usage improvements in the industry.
Under the agreement, mines will develop water saving plans based on set guidelines, and will report annually according to specified templates.
Research carried out at 39 different mining operations, including coal, gold, platinum, diamonds, chrome, iron ore, manganese, copper, heavy mineral sands and dolomite quarries, has been shown to be representative of the industry and provides a set of use efficiency benchmarks.
Methodologies used in the study and in the guidelines have drawn extensively on work done by the Minerals Council of Australia, which is known to have among the world’s most advanced water conservation and demand management systems.
Roger Baxter, chief executive of Minerals Council SA, said this project had firmly reinforced the notion that a great deal of public good can flow from co-operative work between business and government.
