Minister of mineral resources Gwede Mantashe said today that regulating illegal mining in the Northern Cape would help deal with the dangers it poses to society in terms of health, safety, infrastructure, and the costs to the economy.
Addressing the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on his department’s budget vote debate in parliament, Mantashe said illegal mining needed to be regulated because it robs government and the people of South Africa of the benefits from taxes and royalties.
Mantashe’s deputy, Godfrey Oliphant today handed over two mining permits to artisanal miners, also known as Zama Zama, in Kimberley after they successfully negotiated a tailings mining resource from Ekapa Mining and now have access to 500 hectares of ground to mine for themselves.
“We are engaging the diamond industry on this matter. In the Northern Cape, the department has been engaging with artisanal miners to legalise their operations,” Mantashe said.
“On 30 April 2018, they received their mining permits. They will now sell their diamonds in the open market, free from unscrupulous diamond buyers.”
Mantashe also said that there was progress made through work with provincial and local government, as well as law enforcement agencies, to deal with illegal mining.
“As we explore ways to regulate artisanal mining as a means to enable ordinary South Africans participate in mining, we intend having discussions with the minister of police on strengthening approaches to dealing with the scourge of illegal mining,” Mantashe said.
