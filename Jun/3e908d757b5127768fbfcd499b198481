Unless you’ve been locked in an isolation ward for the last week, you’ll know US President Donald Trump met North Korea’s glorious leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore this week.
At the press conference that followed their historic talks (which also happened to last longer than the talks themselves) the two world leaders praised one another, saying they were filled with mutual respect and shaking hands for the camera.
Critics have said the unprecedented encounter in Singapore was more style than substance, producing a document that was short on details about the key issue of Pyongyang’s atomic weapons. That being said, the fact that North Korea is back at the negotiating table with the US is something of a positive step.
What you may not be aware of, however, is the fact that Donald Trump and the White House had a mock trailer made for the summit ahead of the occasion.
Trump apparently showed the trailer to Kim Jong Un on his iPad. Some of the footage highlights include drones delivering parcels, horses running across water, Sylvester Stallone’s visit to the White House and a basketball player throwing down a dunk. The narration is mostly positive throughout, portraying both Trump and Kim Jong Un as potential world peace brokers, but it also includes some some dark allusions as to what might happen if the negotiations don’t go well.
