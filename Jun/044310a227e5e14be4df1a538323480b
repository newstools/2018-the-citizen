Five suspects who were arrested in connection with the murder of former crime intelligence Major-General Hendrick Mogoerane, including the deceased’s wife Cordelia Mogoerane, were today granted bail of R10 000 each by the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court.
Three other accused were denied bail. Magistrate Prince Manyathi said all five suspects would remain behind bars until they their bail is paid.
Altogether, eight suspects were arrested last week after being positively linked to Mogoerane’s murder. His body was found in the back seat of his car in Norkem Park, east of Johannesburg in January.
Investigators were still waiting for the post-mortem results to determine the cause of death as no visible injuries were found on his body.
Mogoerane worked at the South African Police Service’s head office within crime intelligence before retiring in 2017.
