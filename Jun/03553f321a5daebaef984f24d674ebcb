Five people have died and 15 others have been injured following an accident on Nigel Road towards Vosloorus late on Sunday, EWN has reported.
A minibus taxi carrying 16 passengers has collided head-on with a BMW, which burst into flames on impact.
By the time Ekurhuleni emergency services arrived on the scene, it was too late for the driver of the BMW, who was trapped behind the steering wheel, as well as for four of the taxi’s passengers, according to spokesperson William Ntladi.
Ntladi said: “The other patients were actually from the taxi whereby four of them were also killed instantly and some were trapped underneath the vehicle. Emergency services had to use jaws of life.”
Injured passengers have been transported to hospital for treatment, and the police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The road is currently closed off to traffic. Motorists are requested to make use of the R550 as an alternative route.
