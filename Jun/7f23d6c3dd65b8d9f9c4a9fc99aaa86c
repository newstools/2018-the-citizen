The father of  the Top Billing presenter Simba Mhere, who was killed in a car crash three years ago, told the court he wished he had died rather than his son.
During proceedings at the Randburg Magistrates’ Court on Monday, Joseph, the father of Mhere, said he had big dreams for his children and a day never passed without him thinking about Simba.
“I often ask myself why God didn’t take me instead of him.”
Mhere and his friend Kady-Shay O’Bryan were killed in a car crash involving three cars, which  happened on William Nicol Drive in Fourways, Johannesburg, on January 31, 2015. Preshalin Naidoo, 27, was found guilty of two counts of culpable homicide in January.
“I’ll have to die to see him again,” Mhere said.
Naidoo sat in the dock with his head down while the impact statements were being read into record.
O’Bryan’s mother Meghan said in a victim impact statement, which was read to the court by state prosecutor Dinesh Nandkissor: “You took a mother from her daughter and all those who loved her.
“Her brother who’ll never again see his sister and enjoy their close bond. My late daughter will never again be an aunt because of you. My life is shattered and a part of my soul is dead.
“You have refused to take responsibility for what you have done, you may be a man with age but not a true man. You’re a coward.”
Later, Nandkissor read the impact statement from the Mhere’s sister Valerie, an amateur athlete, where she said her brother was good at everything he did and always showed up for her.
“He cancelled work to see me compete. Every pair of running shoes were paid for by my brother. He provided for me.”
“I don’t know how to express the loss I feel. My heart is broken. It hurts to watch videos to hear him laugh again.”
“He’ll never be at another race of mine or be at my wedding. I am an only child now.”
Court continues.
