A police captain accused of racially abusing black police officers briefly appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday.
Captain Jaco Henrico is facing charges of crimen injuria.
Fellow officers at the Pretoria Central Police Station filed various internal and criminal complaints against Henrico for numerous alleged acts of racism against them.
According to Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR), complaints lodged against Henrico date back to 2016 relating to racial abuse, which, they claimed, have not been addressed.
Henrico allegedly used the ‘k-word’ and verbally harassed his colleagues.
Wayne Ncube, LHR attorney and head of the organisation’s strategic litigation programme, has said they recognised the importance of the case.
“LHR have been approached by several police officials to assist them in this matter. This case represents one of numerous cases filed by police officers testifying to acts of racism prevalent in various police stations across the country.”
The case was postponed to July 20 for representations.
