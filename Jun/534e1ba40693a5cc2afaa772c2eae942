The survey, by BSA | The Software Alliance, found that despite the significant risk of encountering malware when using pirated software, some South African companies are prepared to take their chances.
The finding that 32 percent of software installed on computers in South Africa is unlicensed still puts us significantly below the worldwide figure of 37 percent, itself down two percentage points from 2016.
The commercial value of unlicensed software is estimated to be roughly R2.9 billion.

Using pirated software’s risks go beyond the simple fact that it is illegal, with the survey also showing that there is a 33 percent chance of being attacked by malware when using unlicensed software.
“Organisations around the world are missing out on the economic and security benefits that well-managed software provides,” says BSA | The Software Alliance CEO Victoria Espinel.
“Businesses should establish software asset management (SAM) programmes to evaluate and manage the software on their networks. This, in turn, helps organisations reduce the risk of debilitating cyberattacks and helps grow their revenues,” she adds.
Companies can see profits rise by up to 11 percent if they manage their software better, the survey reported.
This, and the incentive of avoiding an attack of the dreaded malware, ready to siphon your data, should motivate more South African businesses to go the legal route in future.
