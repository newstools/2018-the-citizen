A video has emerged of the 43-year-old man accused of raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter being beaten and tortured while being arrested by Reaction Unit SA security officers.
He appeared in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Thursday.
It is alleged the man was raping his stepdaughter since her mother’s death five years ago, holding her captive in their home.


The girl had reportedly been taken to a place of safety and is receiving support to reintegrate into society. She will have to be returned to school once she is stable.
There were reports that sex toys, lingerie and pornographic material were strewn around the stepfather when reaction officers arrived.
When he appeared in court, he had already been hospitalised following the brutal assault by what were initially reported to be angry Verulam residents on Monday in reaction to the allegations.
Reaction officers working for private security company Reaction Unit SA (RUSA) had earlier denied beating the man, but the footage suggests that they did not treat him with kid gloves. By the time this footage was taken, the man was already heavily beaten and the reaction officers can be seen still kicking the man, including directly to his groin, shocking him with a taser and telling him he will be raped in prison himself.
It was earlier reported that RUSA claimed the man was seriously beaten by the community and was taken to Osindisweni Hospital but escaped. RUSA officers again arrested him in Phoenix on Tuesday after he was recognised from one of the security company’s Facebook posts, they said.
However, the man claimed his wounds were inflicted by RUSA officers during his arrest. He had bruising under his chin and eyes, his lips were swollen and he complained of a fractured rib.
Outside the court, angry community members called for “the rapist” to be released to them.
