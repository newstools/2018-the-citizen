Outspoken poet Ntsiki Mazwai on Saturday declared that she would pick former president Jacob Zuma over his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, any day.
The reason for this, Mazwai tweeted, was because Zuma was a “danger to whites”, whereas President Ramaphosa poses a “danger to blacks”.


The poet moved on to tweet other subjects, but the responses that streamed in questioning her position prompted quick elaboration:




Mazwai has never hidden her reservations about the president, saying: “F*ck Ramaphosa,” in 2016 when some suggested Ramaphosa as the man to lead the ANC out of its crisis.
