The South African Weather Service has issued a storm warning, with Cape Town authorities bracing for heavy downpours and the “potential fallout”.  
 
The City of Cape Town said on Wednesday that the storm was set to make landfall on Thursday and continue into Friday, but that departments were on standby.
 
Disaster risk management spokesperson Charlotte Powell said the South African Weather Service predicted gale force winds of up to 70 kilometres an hour.
 
“With the wind speed forecast to pick up late tonight, we caution residents to be on alert for possible damage to their homes, as well as trees that may be uprooted and could affect travelling as well as powerlines.”
 
Powell urged the public to stay away from coastal areas where rough sea conditions will coincide with the spring tide. 

The City’s call centre can be reached on 0860 103 089.
