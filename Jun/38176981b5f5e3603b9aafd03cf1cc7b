Supra Mahumapelo said yesterday he believed in the rule of law that held everyone as equal before the law. 
“But also it says, in principle, that we cannot, as some of the media are doing, embark on the onslaught of a court of public opinion and find someone guilty in order to psychologically influence judges and society in general,” he added, explaining his presence at the Durban High Court yesterday. 
“uBaba Zuma remains innocent like anyone else until those investigations are done and enough information is collected to prove otherwise,” Mahumapelo said. 
“If we judge people by the court of public opinion, which is unfair, and if we carry on in this way, then this fragile democracy of ours, which in turn is only 24 years old now, will not be sustained.” 
He cautioned everyone, including the media, to ensure people were not “judged unfairly before a credible institution was put in place to make such decisions”. 
“And that is why, in the context of the ANC national executive committee deciding to allow individuals to go and attend the hearing of the case, that is why I am here to show my support.”
