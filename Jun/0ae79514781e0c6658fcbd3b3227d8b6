Relentless efforts by the Limpopo police to eradicate the existence of illegal explosives in the province has yielded positive results, with the recent arrest of seven suspects, says police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe.
The suspects were arrested on Thursday night, June 21, during an operation conducted in Musina, at the Beitbridge port of entry. The suspects were en route to Gauteng, Bosveld Review reports.

“Seven suspects, including a woman, were stopped in their tracks after their suspicious vehicle was stopped, and searched and 50 fused caps and 10 blasting cartridges were confiscated,” Ngoepe explained.
The origin of the explosives is still being determined, although it is believed that this might be part of a bigger syndicate, and may be linked to the recent spate of cash-in-transit heists. However, Ngoepe says ongoing police investigations will tell if this is true.
The suspects will soon appear before the Musina Magistrates’ Court to face charges of possession of illegal explosives and the Illegal Immigration Act.
SAPS acting provincial commissioner Major-General Jan Scheepers has applauded the teams involved in the arrest for a “sterling job done”.
