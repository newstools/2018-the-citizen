All Gauteng law enforcement agencies were hard at work during the weekend and conducted a staggering 243 operations aimed at dealing with criminal activities in the province.
Out of the many arrests that were made, law enforcement agencies in the province also successfully recovered a hijacked state vehicle belonging to Gauteng MEC for sports and recreation, Faith Mazibuko.
It is alleged that three armed men confronted the Gauteng MEC for sports and recreation’s bodyguard, and demanded the car keys from him.
The suspects then drove off with the guard, who was waiting for the MEC in the official vehicle, Mercedes Benz ML 500, until they dropped him off at Bosmont, near Sophiatown.
His service pistol was stolen in the process. The police managed to arrest the three suspects and recovered the stolen car in Eldorado Park, south of Johannesburg.
“The law enforcement agencies’ acts of bravery in dealing with criminal elements has proven once again that Gauteng police are determined to deal with those who break the law. We will continue to prioritise cases that involve our law-abiding citizens irrespective of one’s social or political standing.
“I call upon the criminal justice system to expedite all these cases and ensure that the maximum sentence is imposed against all the suspects that were apprehended during the weekend. This will send a stern warning to all those who are breaking the law that Gauteng has no place for criminals,” said Nkosi-Malobane.
