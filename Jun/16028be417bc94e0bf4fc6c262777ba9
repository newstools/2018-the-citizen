Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane on Wednesday apologised to MPs for her no-show at a meeting because of a “family emergency” last week.
“I would like to again apologise for not being able to make it on the 6th of June, and I’ve tried my best to attend because we’ve already made the arrangements,” Mkhwebane said without providing Parliament’s justice portfolio committee with details of the family emergency.
MPs accepted her apology, though some still bemoaned the late notice of her cancelling the meeting.
“On a very serious note, those who were present on that meeting last week, we felt very much disrespected,” said African National Congress (ANC) MP Madipoane Mothapo.
Mkhwebane and her team are expected to brief MPs on the public protector rules and policies on the appointment of a special adviser to the executive authority.
