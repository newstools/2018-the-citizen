Minister of mineral resources Gwede Mantashe says he intends to publish the draft Mining Charter today for public comments before it is finalised and gazetted.
This follows weeks of nationwide engagements with stakeholders and social partners. 
 

“Publishing of the charter moves us a step forward in terms of ensuring regulatory and policy certainty for the industry. We urge members of the public to submit their comments, views and ideas in order to shape the charter,” Mantashe said.

 
The Mining Charter was a thorny issue during the tenure of Mantashe’s predecessor, Mosebenzi Zwane, setting him on a collision course with the mining industry. The industry decided to take the charter to court for review.
