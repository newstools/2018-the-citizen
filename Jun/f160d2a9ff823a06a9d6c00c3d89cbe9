Two of the three bodies discovered in a cave in Schurveberg, near Vlakplaas in Pretoria, have yet to be identified, Centurion Rekord reports.
Two of the bodies were discovered by the property owner’s daughter, Tina Avanezis, on May 21. The third body was found by police during a search two days later.

The identity of the third body was established last week.
“One of the deceased Lukas Ntshabeleng, aged 45, was positively identified by family members,” said police spokesperson Captain Agnes Huma.
Two families were said to have come forward to claim the two unidentified bodies.
Police are, however, awaiting DNA results to be able to positively identify the deceased, Huma said.
Further information regarding the time and cause of death was not immediately available.
