According to the mother, her child came back from school on Thursday, June 7, and she noticed there was something wrong with her.
“When I was bathing her, I noticed something unusual on her underwear, and asked if someone had touched her private part. She started crying, and said she was scared to talk because the boys said they would hit her.
“She finally told me that they took her to the school’s toilet and touched her private part.”
The mother said she went to the school on Monday morning with her child, and teachers asked the girl to point at the boys who touched her.
“I was told by the principal to go to the clinic and when I got there, they did an HIV test and checked if anything happened to her. They confirmed that she had been violated, and the matter was reported to the police.”
On Tuesday, the child was also taken to Thuthuzela Care Centre, and a doctor confirmed her story.
“I am now scared to send her to the school due to safety reasons. She has not been going to school since last Monday.”
Umhlali SAPS spokesperson Captain Vinny Pillay confirmed the incident was reported to the police, and that they were still investigating the matter.
