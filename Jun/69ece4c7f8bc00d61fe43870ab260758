The African National Congress (ANC) in North West discussed the names of people who will take over the position of the premier, acting provincial secretary Susana Dantjie said today.
She said the ANC led five-a-side provincial alliance meeting in Rustenburg yesterday.
“The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the names of proposed candidates for the vacant position of premier of Bokone Bophirima [North West] province. These names will be finalised by the ANC Provincial Executive Committee for recommendation to the National Executive Committee.”
Former premier Supra Mahumapelo resigned from the position on May 23.
On Monday, the ANC said Mahumapelo would remain an ordinary member of the provincial legislature.
