The couple was arrested on May 24, 2015, after police received information about two children being abused and mistreated.
“According to the police records, the couple allegedly forced their 11-year-old daughter to have sexual intercourse with older men who in return paid them a certain amount of money. Their nine-year-old boy was apparently abused,” Earle said.
Free State provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Moeketsi Sempe thanked those who played a role in the pair being rearrested.
“My appreciation to the community for ensuring that the two are brought back to book so as to protect innocent children who they failed to protect as parents,” Sempe said.
“This shows that through a multidisciplinary approach, crime in our communities can be minimised and criminals brought to justice.”
