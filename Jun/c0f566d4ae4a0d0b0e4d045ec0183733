The Sunday Times seems to have gotten on social media users’ bad side, as scores have been blocking the paper’s Twitter page.
This is according to a trail of tweets that began on Sunday, but the reason for the mass exodus still remains unclear.
Many Twitter users, including Black First Land First leader Andile Mngxitama, who said people were tired of fake news, have jumped on the bandwagon and blocked the paper on Twitter.


The campaign to block the paper stems from Twitter users’ apparent belief that the paper is saturated with racist, anti-black reporting.
The #BlockSundayTimes hashtag appears to be an attempt to create a kind of solidarity among certain social media users against the Sunday paper.
A few have warned media houses to be wary, accusing the Sunday Times of negative reports involving black people. The mass resistance from Twitter users appears to also be linked to the public protector.


The exact reason for the mass exodus remains a mystery.
