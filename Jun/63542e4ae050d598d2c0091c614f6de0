The June salaries of workers for the grounded state-owned South African airline, SA Express, will be paid, unions and government said on Thursday.
In a statement, the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) on Thursday thanked Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan for securing emergency funding so the salaries for the cash-strapped airline could be paid.
“The minister has been engaging various institutions for finance arrangements to alleviate SAX’s immediate liquidity constraint which has enabled SAX acting chief executive Matsietsi Mokholo to confirm to staff that their June salaries will now be paid,” Fedusa said.
Gordhan’s spokesman Adrian Lackay confirmed Gordhan had secured funding.
Fedusa asked for Gordhan’s intervention after Fedusa said Mokholo informed them workers may not be paid on June 25.
The airline was grounded in May after the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) suspended its certificate of airworthiness, the operator’s certificate, as well as aircraft maintenance approvals, citing a deficient safety management system, which posed a huge public safety risk.
