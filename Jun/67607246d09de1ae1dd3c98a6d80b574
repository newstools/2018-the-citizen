Opposition parties on Wednesday joined the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in expressing shock at the killing of MP Sibusiso Radebe.
Radebe was shot dead during an attempted hijacking in Roodepoort on Tuesday night.
“We call on authorities to act swiftly to apprehend suspects and investigate the killing – this does not bode well as we head toward the 2019 elections which will be fraught with political tensions,” African Christian Democratic Party MP Cheryllyn Dudley said in a statement.
Democratic Alliance chief whip John Steenhuisen also extended his condolences to Radebe’s family, friends and the ANC caucus.
“Radebe will be lovingly remembered by his family, friends and the ANC as a servant of the people who worked hard to improve the lives of South Africans,” Steenhuisen said.
Radebe was from Elukwatini in Mpumalanga.
Radebe joined Parliament in 2009, and has served on various portfolio committees, including higher education and training, and energy. At the time of his death, he was a member of the portfolio committee on transport.
