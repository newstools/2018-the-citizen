One of the five men allegedly involved in a cash-in-transit heist in Benoni last month abandoned his bail application at the Boksburg Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday.
Paul Sibanda, 28, together with Thato Gaopantwe, 26, Colin Hadebe, 42, Sibusiso Khumalo, 34, and Thabo Molefe, 32, allegedly bombed two cash vehicles on their way to a bank from their depot in Kempton Park last month.
State prosecutor Maria Fife told magistrate Emanuel Magamba a lot of ballistics evidence was required for the case and asked for a two-month postponement.
The legal representatives of all the men did not oppose the postponement, while Khumalo requested legal aid.
The matter was postponed to August 13 for further investigation.
Video recordings of the crime scene went viral, showing a shootout in which security guards were injured.
