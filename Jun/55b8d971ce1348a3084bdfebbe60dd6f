Gauteng police have arrested four people and recovered Sports and Culture MEC Faith Mazibuko’s Mercedes Benz SUV hijacked on Saturday in Johannesburg.
”The suspects were arrested in Eldorado Park in the early hours of Monday, 04 June. They were found in possession of the hijacked vehicle, firearm believed to be the one taken from the [MEC’s] protector and another unlicensed firearm,” said spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo.
”The suspects will be charged with hijacking, kidnapping as well as possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition. They will appear at Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court in due course.”
A group of armed men approached Mazibuko’s guards in the Johannesburg CBD as they waited for Mazibuko by the vehicle. One of the guards was inside the vehicle and was later found unharmed in Bosmont.
The incident came two weeks after Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga was hijacked in Midrand. The two armed hijackers accosted Msimanga as he was leaving a restaurant, and sped away in his silver Mercedes Benz CLS 250. He was alone with no bodyguards at the time.
