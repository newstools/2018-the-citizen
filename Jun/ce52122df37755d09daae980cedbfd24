A man was killed and two other people were injured when two cars and a bakkie collided on the N3 near the London Road off-ramp near Modderfontein in Johannesburg on Saturday night, paramedics said.
ER24 paramedics, along with another service, arrived on the scene to find two cars and a bakkie in the left-hand emergency lane, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said on Sunday.
“Upon closer inspection, paramedics found the body of a man lying partially beneath one of the vehicles. Assessment showed that the man had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead.”
Two other people were found one the scene. A man, believed to be in his 60s, was found to be in a critical condition while a woman was found to have sustained moderate injuries.
Paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured man with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, they were transported to nearby hospitals for urgent treatment. The cause of the crash was unknown at this stage, Meiring said.
