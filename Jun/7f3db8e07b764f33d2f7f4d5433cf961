Ten people arrested in connection with a violent protest in Reagile were released on bail of R1 000 each on Friday.
They appeared in the Koster Magistrates’ Court, facing charges of public violence and possession of suspected stolen property. Their case was postponed to June 28.
A truck transporting live chickens was looted, allegedly by six of the suspects, along the R52 road in Reagile on Thursday morning, following fresh protests on Wednesday night.
Residents, mostly youngsters, barricaded the R509 between Koster and Swartruggens as well as the R52 between Koster and Rustenburg with rocks and burning tyres.
This was after five people were arrested on Wednesday night in connection with a violent protest last month.
In that protest, Kgetlengrivier mayor Kim Medupe’s residential house, her guesthouse business and another building she used to rent out were torched. A councillor’s house and six cars were also set alight.
At least 44 people have been arrested since violent protest erupted in the Kgetlengrivier municipality in May 23. They were all expected to appear in court on June 28.
Residents of Koster and Derby took to the streets demanding delivery of basic services, and are now calling for mayor Kim Medupe to resign.
The situation was calm in Koster on Friday, and the R52 was reopened for traffic.
