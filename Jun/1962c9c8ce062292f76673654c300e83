The ANC in North West has made the decision that Supra Mahumapelo will retain his position as a member of the provincial legislature, EWN has reported.
Mahumapelo announced his resignation as North West premier at Luthuli House in May.
The ANC’s decision to retain the controversial former premier means taxpayers will continue to pay him a salary.
Mahumapelo resigned as premier following widespread accusations of corruption and maladministration that led to violent protests across the province.

Party spokesperson Gerald Modise confirmed Mahumapelo would remain in the provincial legislature until the ANC decides otherwise.
“The provincial chairperson, comrade Supra Mahumapelo, will remain as a member of the provincial legislature because he has only resigned as a premier. As you will remember, before you become the premier, you become a member of the provincial legislature. Therefore, he has only resigned as the premier and he will remain as a member of the provincial legislature until the ANC decides otherwise.”
