On Tuesday it was announced that the next edition of the glamorous Miss America pageant will scrap swimsuits and be more inclusive of women of all sizes.
It also no longer wants to be called a “pageant” but a “competition”. They have branded the change “Miss America 2.0.”
Contest organisers have bowed to pressure from lobby groups that have long accused beauty pageants of promoting sexism and the objectification of women.
Gretchen Carlson, the chairwoman of the Miss America board of directors, confirmed on the TV show Good Morning America that the event would no longer feature a swimsuit competition.


“We will no longer judge our candidates on their outward physical appearance. That’s huge,” Carlson said.


She added that the new Miss America competition would be more inclusive to women of “all shapes and sizes”.
The USA is in first place on the rankings of having the most obese people on earth.
