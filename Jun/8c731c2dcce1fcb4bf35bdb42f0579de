City of Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba has called an emergency council meeting on Monday morning to attempt to sell a proposed increase in rates and taxes to its members so his R59-billion budget can be passed, EWN has reported.
The tariff increases were rejected by the ANC, with the EFF’s decision to abstain sending Mashaba back to the negotiating table.
Failure to pass the budget before the end of the month could see Johannesburg placed under administration by the ANC-led provincial government.
Mashaba is now in a race against time to convince the council to accept his budget.

The mayor has warned that rising costs can’t be absorbed by the City, saying that an increase of the financial burden placed on ratepayers is the only viable option.
“We convince everyone to see sense in this, otherwise we’ve got to reduce our services substantially to our residents.”
Both the EFF and ANC, though, have said residents can’t afford another increase.
“Broader consultation needs to happen on the issue of the tariff hike, but also, the inputs of the rates payers association, among others, must be considered when effecting a hike on tariff,” says the ANC’s Jolidee Matongo.
Silumko Mabona of the EFF says the party “vehemently‚ unreservedly‚ unapologetically and ferociously” rejects the proposed increases in water‚ electricity‚ sewerage‚ sanitation and refuse removal.
Whether Mashaba can get out of this tight spot should become clear following Monday’s special council meeting.
