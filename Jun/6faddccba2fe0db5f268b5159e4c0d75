A photo of businessman Nico Matlala and Lebo Mabe, accompanied by a caption implying the couple is back together again, has surfaced.
The photo on social media has people talking, as it suggests the two have kissed and made up.
Matlala in the post appears to thank Mabe for being kind enough to let him back in her life. “I can never imagine having to live mine without you in it.”
“You are a woman among women, I promise things will never be the same as they were before. You are the complete part to my puzzle, there’s no other like you. Mogatšhaka #TheMatlalas #TheReunion #NewBeginnings.”

The apparent new beginnings have been received with disbelief, as some social media users believe it’s a sham.
Matlala and Mabe’s relationship hit tough times when the couple had each other arrested last year.
The couple opened criminal charges against each other in December.
Mabe accused Matlala of assault and opened an assault charge against him. Matlala countered the move with a charge of malicious damage to property.
Matlala threw Mabe out of his house, and was seen with a new girl on social media soon after.
Twitter detectives seem to have thrown a spanner in the works with a photo of Mabe next to a different man. Mabe appears to be thanking a longtime friend for being there for her.


Matlala and Mabe shot to notoriety last year when Matlala bragged about taking Mabe from Shaun Stylist, a popular fashionista.
