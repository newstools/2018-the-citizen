The department of health in Mpumalanga has issued a statement dismissing claims made by EFF Mpumalaga provincial leader Collen Sedibe after he alleged that patients at Themba Hospital were being fed a slice of bread and a glass of water once a day in a Facebook post, Mpumalanga News reports.
The department stated Sedibe was misleading the public with false information.

The controversial Facebook post.
“Pholoso Mbatsane is not contracted to serve meals for patients at Themba hospital. A service provider was appointed, but it is not Pholoso. The EFF leader is trying to score political votes by publishing false allegations just to try and tarnish the good work of government.
“The department would like to assure the public that patients at Themba hospital are provided meals three times a day. No complaints have been received or forwarded to us regarding the matter,” the statement read.
When contacted for comment, Mbatsane simply responded: “There is nothing like that because I do not have a contract with the hospital. The last time I checked, I was contracted with the nursing college. Collen is just a drunkard, and right now he is not even taking my calls. He should get his facts straight and stop accusing me.”
Sedibe is adamant that Mbatsane is the service provider, and claims he is monopolising the system. “I can refer you to patients at the hospital as well as their relatives if you do not believe me. He is robbing the hospital, and we have raised this issue with the MEC,” he said.
