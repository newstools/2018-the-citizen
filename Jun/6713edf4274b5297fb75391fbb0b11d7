A man is in a critical condition after a head-on collision on the M7 westbound near the Bellville off-ramp in Malvern in Durban in the early hours of Saturday morning, paramedics said.
Paramedics arrived on the scene soon after 1am to find that a car and a truck had collided head-on, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said.
“The driver of the light motor vehicle had sustained critical injuries and advanced life support paramedics worked to stabilise the man by putting him on a manual ventilator on the scene. Once stabilised he was then rushed through to a nearby hospital for the further care that he required. The truck occupants escaped with minor injuries.”
The cause of the crash was unknown, Jamieson said.
