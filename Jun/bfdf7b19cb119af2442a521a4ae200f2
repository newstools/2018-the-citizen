As part of Youth Month celebrations, the Gauteng provincial government has urged high school pupils, unemployed youth and graduates to attend the fourth annual Youth Expo to get connected to jobs and business opportunities. 
The expo will take place from Saturday until June 17 at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg. 
“The expo has 140 exhibitors to provide information and live services to youth on careers, jobs and work exposure, as well as how to start, run and operate a business,” Gauteng provincial government spokesperson Thabo Masebe says. 
The expo will also have sports activities, including daily aerobics, football and netball, with soccer clubs Orlando Pirates and Sundowns among the teams set to interact with the youth. 
Other activities include registering for skills development via the Tshepo 1 Million Programme, exposure to the film industry and the screening of Inxeba (The Wound) and Black Panther. 
The province will also host National Youth Day celebrations on June 16, with President Cyril Ramaphosa addressing young people at the Orlando Stadium, after the Thuma Mina Walk from Morris Isaacson High School to the Hector Pieterson Memorial.
