He’s not expecting them to play like veterans but Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus has high hopes for his young wingers, Sbu Nkosi (22) and Aphiwe Dyantyi (23).
The duo will make their Test debuts against England at Ellis Park on Saturday.

Sharks star Nkosi in particular has been knocking on the door for some time now, having been included for last year’s Rugby Championship.
“I’m really excited about them,” said Erasmus.
“I was still in Ireland (with Munster) but I read a lot of reports about how close Sbu was to actually gaining a Test cap. He’s been a standout winger in South Africa.”
However, the key to Nkosi’s rise has been the fact that he’s adapted immensely quick.
In 2017, he was an exciting attacker capable to creating and rounding off some great tries before his second season at senior level has been less flamboyant.
Yet that doesn’t mean it’s been a poorer season.
In fact, all Nkosi has done is illustrate that he possesses the all-round game to potentially be a successful international winger.
At this level, wings need to look for work, find themselves in good field positions and defend well.
It’s really not (just) about scoring tries.
“Sbu’s done a lot of great work on attack and defence this year,” said Erasmus.
“He’s certainly improved in the areas we thought he was vulnerable in initially. He’s really getting better.”
Dyantyi lit up Super Rugby’s early rounds with his try-scoring ability but as the Lions’ campaign overall grew far more inconsistent, he’s also had to deal with scraps instead of full-on feasts.
“Aphiwe is an exciting youngster. What counts in his favour too is that he’s playing at home,” said Erasmus.
“He’s performed consistently well at wing and centre. It’s a wonderful opportunity and it’s form that’s being rewarded.
