As World Refugee Day was celebrated today, the National Freedom Party (NFP) called for government to set strict regulations on how refugees operate in the country and restrict their movement, saying that South Africa was full of criminals, not refugees.
NFP spokesperson Sabelo Sigudu said that refugees and asylum seekers were “masterminds of crime” in South Africa but were given a “first-class treatment” and some operated businesses illegally without even paying taxes.
“It is an open secret that many foreigners are in South Africa to sell drugs mostly to our vulnerable youth and teenagers, for example in South Africa we never knew nyaope, woonga, Mercedes and all these sorts of dangerous drugs before the arrival of foreigners,” Sigudu said.
“As we mark World Refugee Day today, we want to state that, the time has come for the government of South Africa to protect its citizens. We won’t be surprise to learn that even the cash-in-tansit heist which have gone unruly have foreigners behind many of them.”
Sigudu said the party’s stance on refugees was not “controversial” and they were prepared to defend it in court, adding that the NFP does not hate refugees but will not tolerate and accept the crimes they were allegedly committing since “no one is brave enough to raise these issues.”
