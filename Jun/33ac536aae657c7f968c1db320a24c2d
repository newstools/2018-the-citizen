The combined average dam level for the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) was at 31.51 percent today as compared to 20.97 percent at the same time last year.
According to the department of water and sanitation (DWS) in the Western Cape, last week’s rain brought some relief as major dams steadily improved. The increased inflow into the rivers was sufficient to lead to significant inflows into the dams.
DWS Western Cape regional head Rashid Khan said there was a noticeable turnaround in the province, however much more rain was required to significantly increase the dam levels.
“We urge water users, domestic and industries to continue using water sparingly,” said Khan.
Khan added that the department would only consider reducing water restrictions after the province has experienced enough rain.
Meanwhile, the City of Cape Town had encouraged residents to continue saving and not to be tempted to relax water-saving efforts due to the cold and wet weather that Cape Town has been experiencing.
“This time last year, dam storage levels were at 21,2 percent. Consumption was 615 million litres per day. We are in a better position today due to the enormous additional savings over the past summer period.
“At this stage, we need to ensure that we adhere to the targets and restrictions that we have set. The national department of water and sanitation requires Cape Town to get down to a collective usage target of 450 million litres per day. It remains important to get as close to it as possible to ensure that water resources are stretched in the face of further rainfall uncertainty,” said executive deputy mayor Ian Neilson.
“We are keeping up the saving efforts from our side through our ongoing pressure management efforts, among others, and by driving our winter water-saving campaign to encourage our water users to continue being great winter water ambassadors,” he said.
