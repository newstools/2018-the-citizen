Food Lover’s Market today confirmed that it has raised enough money to feed 733 179 hungry people through FoodForward SA.
Head of sustainability for the Food Lover’s Market Group, Andrew Millson said they raised R 579 152.53 during its Hunger Month campaign in May.
The Hunger Month campaign, saw the retailer partnering with Tru-Cape Fruit Marketing, Rugani Carrots and Simpl Fruit Juices. It was a substantial increase on the 2017 campaign – at the end of the 2017 Hunger Month campaign, a total of R243 937 was raised, which contributed to feeding 280 000 individuals.
“Launched on 1 May 2018, consumers were invited to participate by making the active decision to purchase from the campaign partners, as well as shopping in a Food Lover’s Market on World Hunger Day on 28 May 2018,” Millson said.
Millison said the Hunger Month campaign, piloted by Food Lover’s Market’s sustainability arm Earth Lovers, seeks to raise awareness of the plight of vulnerable South Africans that go without a meal on a daily basis.
“As part of our consistent CSI impetus, we support and sponsor local and national charitable organisations so that we can create meaningful social impact – primarily in the areas of food and health.”
“Our partners in this campaign – Tru-Cape Fruit Marketing, Rugani Carrots and Simpl Fruit Juices – have been incredible in their support of this initiative. Of course, it’s not just about raising funds towards meals, but also an opportunity to shine a massive spotlight on the millions of South Africans that are vulnerable to hunger – meaning that they do not always know where they will find their next meal,” Millson said.
