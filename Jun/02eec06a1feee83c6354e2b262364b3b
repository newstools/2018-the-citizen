Six more cash-in-transit heist suspects have been arrested by the police, police minister Bheki Cele has announced.
Cele commended the SAPS for the arrests, saying a multi-disciplinary team intercepted the six men wanted in connection with aggravated robberies, particularly cash-in-transit heists.
Recently, South Africa has been plagued by a number of these robberies in majority of the provinces prompting the minister and national police commissioner to implement extra-ordinary intervention measures nationally, a statement from Cele’s office says.
“Since the implementation of these interventions on 4 June 2018 several suspects have been arrested and firearms, money and even explosives and explosive devices have been seized. More importantly, no cash-in-transit heists have been reported since then,” the statement reads.
“I am satisfied with the hard work and dedication shown by the multi-disciplinary teams,” said Cele.
“The arrest of these six suspects brings the total to 21, including a number two on a list of top 20, that have been arrested since the high density multi-disciplinary stability operation.
“These highly specialized tactical teams will continue to intensify operations until we are satisfied that we have everyone that is terrorizing fellow South Africans while committing cash-in-transit robberies and related crimes,” Cele added.
