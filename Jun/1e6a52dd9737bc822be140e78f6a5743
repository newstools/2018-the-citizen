Judgment is expected in the Port Elizabeth High Court in the case against a former cop charged with a murder, in which his official firearm was used.
However, Walter Francis, 29 , may be off the hook for murder after senior prosecutor Jason Thysse conceded the State had not established a “common purpose” in the murder of a suspected gangster Denton Rademeyer in Bethelsdorp in Port Elizabeth’s Northern areas.
No evidence placed Francis on the scene of the 2014 murder and there was no evidence of a conspiracy, the court previously heard.
The State has asked the court to convict Francis on a charge of culpable homicide instead.
The State alleges that on October 25, 2014, Francis, Enzorich Kroates, 22, and Clement Kogana, 29, were at the home of Shane Potberg, 34, when a shooting incident occurred.
Following the shooting incident, Francis gave his official police firearm and several rounds of ammunition to Potberg, a suspected gangster.
At the time of the alleged crime, Francis was stationed at Humewood police station.
