The first day (yesterday, June 21) of the two-day June council sitting in the City of Johannesburg came and went with no official council business being considered, the Sandton Chronicle has reported.
This was because of the African National Congressâ€™ (ANC) disruptions, which stemmed from a motion about expropriated land in Rabie Ridge not being accepted for debate in council by the programming committee.
As the City of Joburg speaker entered the council, ANC members could be heard booing. The ANC then requested a 25-minute break.
After taking a lunch break, ANC councillors continued to fill the chamber with loud song and protest, resulting in speaker of council Vasco da Gama suspending the meeting. Read the details here.
The council sitting continued this morning, and journalist Chantelle Fourie was at the meeting to provide updates.
