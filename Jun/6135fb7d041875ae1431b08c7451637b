Many white people have taken to social media, sharing the post and asking whether she will need to answer for her outburst in court, or whether there’s a double standard in South Africa when it comes to racism.
The video sees an angry black woman calling a police officer a “white c**t” several times, as well as an “uneducated piece of s**t” alongside several f bombs.


Vicki Momberg, who became the first South African to be sent to prison for crimen injuria,  or the act of “unlawfully, intentionally and seriously impairing the dignity of another”, was sentenced to an effective 2 years of prison for her racist ranting at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court in March.
Momberg used the “k word” 48 times.
The issue of black racism in South Africa is a contentious one, with some black people arguing that due to structural oppression, white supremacy and South Africa’s history of apartheid and colonisation, black people can’t be racist.
Some sharing the post of the “black Vicki Momberg” are arguing that it is equivalent to Momberg’s crime. These voices include Afriforum’s Kallie Kriel.




Others have pointed out that the “k word” is a particularly offensive and hurtful slur and that there is no equivelent term that black people can level against white people.


The idea that South African media only focusses on hate speech directed against black people seems to have struck a chord on social media, with many mainly white people asking if the incident will be covered as widely in the media as Momberg’s outburst was.
The view that there are double standards in South African society, media and law is put forward in the below video by vlogger Renaldo Gouws, which currently has over ten thousand views on YouTube.
Whether or not she will be prosecuted like the white woman she has been compared to remains to be seen.
