A video of a nurse allegedly harassing a woman in the maternity ward in the Mpumalanga town of Tonga was recorded by a patient last week, reports Mpumalanga News.
Ncobile Mhawule, who is six months’ pregnant, had been referred to the hospital from the local clinic after she collapsed at work. In the video, the nurse can be seen allegedly forcing the woman to get off her chair.
On arrival, she alleges that the nurse in the video clip turned her away because there was no doctor who would attend to her.
“I went back to the casualty ward where another nurse assisted me and told me to go back to Ward 6, and that is when I was pushed off a chair by the nurse who refused to help me,” said Mhawule.
She had allegedly been told by the nurse to close her legs as she was “annoying”.
