Linda Lengwati, 24, appeared before magistrate Renier Boshoff after being charged with the murder that occurred on May 2 at their 10th Avenue home.
The granny, who raised the accused, was said to have been hit over the head by her grandson with an old case pressing iron. The force of the impact cracked her skull, which led to her death.
A witness allegedly heard the victim calling for help and went to the house. He found it locked and knocked on the door, but no one opened. He heard the accused, whom he knew, ordering his granny to repeat after him the words: “I am the way, the truth, and the life.”
Afterwards, the witness heard a loud scream from the victim, followed by silence. Police who were called to the scene asked the accused to open the door, but he threw the house keys through the window instead, enabling police to get in and arrest him.
He opted to represent himself and pleaded not guilty. He claimed the murder involved witchcraft. It was alleged the accused is a drug addict.
