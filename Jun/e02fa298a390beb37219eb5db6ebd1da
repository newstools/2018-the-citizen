Eskom has announced there’s a low probability of rotational load shedding on Saturday, after several generating units were returned to service.
“We continue to encourage residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly by switching off geysers during the day, especially during peak periods [7am to 10am and 6pm to 9pm], as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances,” Eskom said in a statement.
In the event that load shedding became necessary, Eskom and municipalities would use the published rotational load shedding schedules.
For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website. Eskom customers can also contact the customer contact centre at 0860-037-566.
South Africans have been bracing themselves for possible load shedding as Eskom workers continue their strike over wage negotiations. The unions in talks with Eskom accused the power parastatal of wasting their time yesterday, and that they were disappointed that their demands had not been met.
Talks are set to resume next Wednesday.
