Police opened fire on protesters, journalists and bystanders alike in Eersterust on Wednesday afternoon. They fired rubber bullets without warning, injuring several people, including a woman who was sitting flat on the ground.
A Citizen photographer was shot twice in the back, and a Citizen journalist broke her knee as she tried to get to safety.
Eersterust ward councillor Benjamin Lawrence was also shot twice in the back.
The police used their water tanks to put out burning fires before they started shooting in an attempt to clear Stormvoel Road.
The community members say they plan to continue protesting.

“They shot me while I was sitting down … in my face. They [are] shooting at women – they should be ashamed.”
“I am angry because I did nothing to provoke them. They shot my cheek away,” said Victoria Daniels, one of the victims.
Daniels is one of the two people who were shot in the head.

Dashley Lottering said he had just arrived to see what was happening, and had not done anything wrong when he was simply shot.
The actions of the police have enraged the community, who say their protest was peaceful and that they did not provoke the police.
The shooting marked the second time the community was fired at without warning today.
The community is protesting a lack of service delivery, lack of housing for the poor and constant power outages.

Here is footage from earlier, where a woman was shot in the face while just standing by.
