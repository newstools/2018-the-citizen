In an act of criminality that turned out to be a bit too brazen, three men have been arrested for stealing the hubcaps of a police car while it was parked at a crime scene, eNCA has reported.
The police confirmed the South African Police Service’s (SAPS) Humewood Crime Prevention Unit, Port Elizabeth’s K9 Unit and the Flying Squad worked together to apprehend three suspects for the theft on Saturday.
Why three different units were needed to bring the hubcap thieves to book is unclear. Whether or not the South African police employed more manpower to apprehend the men who stole their hubcaps than they would usually do to other crimes is also a matter of speculation.
The police reported an on-duty member of the SAPS forensics services was returning to his vehicle after attending to a crime scene on Saturday when he was informed by a member of the community that two men had removed the hubcaps off his vehicle and taken them.
The men were seen allegedly getting into a VW Microbus.

The member of the forensic services followed the suspects while requesting assistance from his colleagues.
Within a short period of time – unsurprising considering who the victims of the crime were – members of SAPS Humewood Crime Prevention Unit, PE’s K9 Unit and the Flying Squad joined in the search.
The vehicle was spotted on the N2, and was pulled over by police.
Three suspects, aged 36, 41 and 47, were arrested on charges of theft from a motor vehicle and possession of suspected stolen property.
The stolen hubcaps were found in the vehicle.
The suspects will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates’ Court on Monday, proof that, depending on who the victims are, the wheels of justice can turn pretty quickly.
