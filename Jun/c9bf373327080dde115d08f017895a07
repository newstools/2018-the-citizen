Parliament’s portfolio committee on police today announced it had extended the deadline for the public to make input on proposed amendments to the law governing South Africa’s police watchdog, Ipid, by a week.
“Members of the public and interested parties are urged to submit written comments before end of business on Friday, 29 June 2019,” committee chairman Francois Beukman said in a statement.
The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) Amendment Bill is aimed at ensuring greater independence of the watchdog’s head.
Those who want to make written submissions can do so by either emailing the committee secretary Pilate Mgwebu on pmgwebu@parliament.gov.za or via telephone on 021-403 2911.
The Constitutional Court gave parliament until September 5 to make the necessary amendments. In 2016, the apex court upheld a high court ruling declaring sections of the Ipid Act unlawful.
The high court action was brought by current Ipid head Robert Mcbride against the former police minister who suspended him in 2015 after the latter accused McBride of doctoring an Ipid investigation report into former Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation boss Anwa Dramat
The Constitutional Court ruled the Ipid head can only be removed for misconduct, incapacity or incompetence following a probe by a parliamentary committee and after a vote won by a two thirds majority in the National Assembly.
