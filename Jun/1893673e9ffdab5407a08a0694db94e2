The Minerals Council South Africa has said the current political developments in the ruling party and the impact at government level have been conducive for the regulatory, operational and investment environment for junior miners in Africa.
Speaking at the Junior Mining Indaba in Johannesburg, Minerals Council chief executive Roger Baxter said they were also playing their role in assisting junior miners who are faced with a number of challenges including, among others, delays in the administration of mining rights and water use licence applications.
“For the first time in several years, thanks to political developments in the ruling African National Congress and their impact at national government level, there now exists a great deal of scope for hope for the future of the mining industry and South Africa as a whole,” Baxter said.
The mining industry has been at loggerheads with the previous minister of mineral resources and challenged his Mining Charter in court, but the hostilities have thawed since Gwede Mantashe took over the portfolio after Cyril Ramaphosa was elected ANC president and subsequently became the country’s president.
