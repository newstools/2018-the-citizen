A new website and a Facebook page was launched today in a bid to assist former mineworkers and their dependents who may be entitled to compensation from a trust fund to pay mineworkers who contracted silicosis or TB at work.
The historic R5 billion settlement was reached last month after three years of extensive negotiations between the companies and the claimants’ attorneys.
The six mining companies are African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony and Sibanye-Stillwater – and attorneys Richard Spoor Inc., Abrahams Kiewitz Inc. and the Legal Resources Centre who represented thousands of mineworkers and their dependents.
The settlement needs to be approved by the South Gauteng High Court, which could take several months. If and when the settlement has been approved‚ a trust will be set up and the process of compensating ex-mine workers will begin.
Until then, former mineworkers or their dependents may register their details on the mineworker database. Both the website and Facebook page will be updated regularly with relevant information.
The website is: www.SilicosisSettlement.co.za – and the Facebook page – www.facebook.com/silicosissettlement.
