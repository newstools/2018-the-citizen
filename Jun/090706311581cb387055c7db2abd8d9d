South Africa’s ruling party today wished former party and State president Thabo Mbeki a happy birthday.
“The ANC wishes Comrade Thabo Mbeki a wonderful 76th birthday, filled with health, more wisdom and immense joy,” the party said in a statement.
“The African National Congress will eternally appreciate former President Mbeki’s unrelenting allegiance to the ANC as well as selflessly giving of himself to the AU and other multilaterals when called on to provide wisdom in conflict ridden countries as their envoy,” a statement from the party said.
“The masses of our people will never forget the contribution he made to our liberation struggle as well as the positive gains on our economy during his leadership of the country.”
Mbeki succeeded Nelson Mandela to become the country’s second democratically elected President in 1999. He was recalled as president in 2008.
