A man is in a critical condition after he apparently lost control of his car and crashed into a lamppost on Libanon Road in Westonaria, southwest of Johannesburg on Friday night, paramedics said.
ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene at about 8.30pm and found the man lying next to the car.
He was immediately treated and transported to a nearby hospital for further medical care, ER24 spokesperson Annine Siddall said.
“Three more men who were passengers in the vehicle did not sustain any serious injuries and they did not want to be transported to hospital. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations,” Siddall said.
