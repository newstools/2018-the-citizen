Remember Dennis Rodman? If you’re a basketball fan, you may recall that he’s a former player who holds several all-time records for rebounding and who played for the Michael Jordan-era Chicago Bulls.
If you couldn’t give a toss about basketball, he’s also famous for dating Madonna, marrying Carmen Electra, head-butting a referee in the face, kicking a cameraman in the groin, posing naked for PETA, starring in a terrible Jean Claude Van Damme film, declaring himself bisexual and then marrying himself and becoming great pals with North Korean’s leader Kim Jong Un.
He’s lived an eventful life, it’s fair to say, but it’s this last item on his lengthy list of controversial activities that saw him recently interviewed on CNN, following the historic meeting between Trump and North Korea’s glorious leader.
In typical fashion, Rodman rambled for the most part, but he did manage to work into the conversation his assertion that he predicted this summit would happen a long time ago. He also became rather emotional and tearful during the interview – which you can have a gander at below:

Other highlights included Rodman’s revelation that Kim Jong Un “is like a big kid, even though he’s very small”, and Trump’s secretary had called him the morning of the summit and said: “Donald Trump is so proud of you, and he thanks you a lot.”
When asked about the fact that Kim Jong Un is responsible for the deaths of a lot of people, Rodman responded that he (Rodman) was not a politician.
