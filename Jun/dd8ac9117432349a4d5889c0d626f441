A police officer is in a critical condition after he was seriously wounded by unknown assailants as he returned to his home in KwaNdengezi in Durban after work at about 10pm on Friday night, KwaZulu-Natal police said.
KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Lt-Gen Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi on Saturday condemned the attack on the constable from the Shongweni K9 unit.
The constable sustained multiple gunshot wounds and was rushed to a local hospital in a critical condition. He was in a stable condition in the intensive care unit.
“Every attempt is being made to trace the perpetrators of this heinous crime. Those who attack our police officers will feel the full wrath of the law bearing down on them and they should always be looking over their shoulders. We wish the member a speedy recovery and he will remain in our thoughts and prayers until then,” Mkhwanazi said.
