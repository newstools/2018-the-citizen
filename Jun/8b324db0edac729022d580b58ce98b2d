City Press has reported that insiders at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) have also alleged that so far the SSCU is bungling the criminal investigation into state capture, and has “absolutely nothing” on Gupta business partner and former President Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane.
The prosecutors tasked with seizing Gupta assets have lost to the family’s lawyers three times now, and those close to the team have painted a picture of a group of people who are too “stretched”, “overwhelmed” and “under pressure” to get anything done.

The Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFA) has expressed unhappiness with the SSCU’s criminal investigation, which they have labelled “very sloppy”, with some staff at the AFA claiming they have been set up for failure.
Among their accusations are allegations that the SSCU has not allowed the AFA access to the necessary dockets and refused to share information. NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku has denied this.
Justice Minister Michael Masutha said last month that attempts are being made to bring the Guptas back to South Africa through an extradition process being negotiated with the United Arab Emirates.
