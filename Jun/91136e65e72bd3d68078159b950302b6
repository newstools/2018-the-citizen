Hunger eventually led to the wayward young male lion, after running loose in the area, successfully being darted and captured not far from where it was first spotted, The Lowvelder has reported.
The ‘Long Tom Lion’ – named after being spotted on the Long Tom Pass about 60km outside of Mbombela – had been roaming the area for the last six days.
Juan de Beer, acting senior manager of the MTPA’s Wildlife Protection Services, confirmed this morning the lion was seen again, this time after killing a cow near the Long Tom Pass’s on the R37.
The MTPA was informed, and veterinarian Dr Ferreira du Plessis and carnivore scientist Gerrie Camacho went in search of it. Although the young male hid in thick bushes, they managed to tranquilise it successfully in a humane manner.
They say they would release the lion once it has recovered from being darted.
