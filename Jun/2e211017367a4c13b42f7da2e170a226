The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) today elected South Africa to serve in the UN Security Council for the term 2019-2020 as a non-permanent member.
This will be the third time that South Africa will be serving in the UN security council since the dawn of democracy in 1994.
President Cyril Ramaphosa said that government was humbled and honoured by the confidence the international community has demonstrated in the country’s capability to contribute to the resolution of global challenges.
“We express our unreserved gratitude and appreciation to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) that nominated us and our continental body, the African Union (AU), that endorsed our candidature,” Ramaphosa said in a statement.
