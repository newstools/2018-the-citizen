To date, PMD has successfully innovated a range of next generation car insurance and products that have created entirely new, affordable options for the millions of South African motorists who previously had no choice but to drive uninsured often as a result of the high cost of traditional comprehensive motor insurance.
PMD has innovated an entirely new product portfolio in the personal and life insurance space and is reaching the millions of South Africans who are simply unable to secure reasonable levels of life cover at affordable rates.

PMD’s mission is to make South African’s lives better by providing them with innovative new insurance solutions that give them affordable, high benefit options not previously available.
Our vision for the future is to become a large, growing insurer that is an entrenched feature of the South African economy. We wish to build a brand that South Africans not only identify with but deeply trust. We wish to deliver a level of service and customer experience that is literally unprecedented in our industry.
Developing innovative insurance products requires forward-thinking employees. PMD staff enjoy incredible comradery, kindness, purpose and deep mutual respect whilst on the journey together. PMD is an organisation that’s not big on titles and hierarchy. Instead, we are an organisation that’s big on teamwork, inclusivity and achieving success together.
What this means is that we believe our ultimate success will be a function of lofty, ambitious goals meeting the highest possible quality of human interactions and relationships. Over the past few years we have worked exceptionally hard at embedding a living value system into the DNA of our business as guiding light for all we do.
