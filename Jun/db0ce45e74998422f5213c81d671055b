A driver allegedly falling asleep behind the wheel on the N12 road in Johannesburg may have led to yesterday’s fatal bus crash, which left two people dead and more than 30 injured. 
Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson Wayne Minnaar confirmed a bus carrying about 60 passengers overturned on the N12 West Ridgeway, near the Xavier Street off-ramp. 
The bus, belonging to APM Bus, was travelling from Eastern Cape to Germiston and Park Station in Johannesburg. 
Minnaar said a vehicle driver allegedly dozed off and his car veered from the N12 east, over the barricade and landed on the N12 west. 
Minnaar reported two people were pronounced dead, while three of the injured passengers were in critical condition in hospital. 
The vehicle driver, also critical in hospital, would face two charges of culpable homicide and one of reckless and negligent driving. 
Minnaar said police were still in the process of verifying the identities of the deceased with the bus company and would contact the families today.
