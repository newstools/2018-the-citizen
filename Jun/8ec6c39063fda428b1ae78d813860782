Mortimer Saunders, the man who confessed to murdering three-year-old Courtney Pieters in May last year, will return to the Western Cape High Court on Tuesday, EWN has reported.
Saunders admitted to the murder of the toddler by poisoning and beating her last year. Details of the murder, which include an element of sexual abuse, have shocked South Africans. Saunders denies raping Pieters, but has admitted to necrophilia.
A pathologist is expected to take the stand on Tuesday morning.
Forensic analyst Luthando Tiya was recalled to the stand for the second time by defence lawyer Mornay Calitz last week.

Calitz recalled Tiya on certain aspects around the accused’s semen found on the top worn by Pieters on the day she was killed.
Blood was also found on the child’s jeans, but not enough DNA could be extracted to yield a profile.
A swab was also taken from the deceased’s right thigh.
Tiya testified he found traces of male DNA, but again, the concentration was too small to yield a profile.
