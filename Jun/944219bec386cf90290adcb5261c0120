A Verulam man who allegedly raped his 10- year-old stepdaughter is back in custody after escaping from hospital.
The 43-year-old man was rearrested by security firm Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) after escaping from the Osindisweni Hospital today.
The man was hospitalized yesterday after community members assaulted him.
Reaction officers were dispatched to a business after staff recognized the suspect from a post on Facebook, where the man was identified as wanted, according to the Phoenix Sun.
The 43-year-old is currently detained at the Verulam police station.
The assaulted man on the ground with sex toys, lingerie and pornographic material lying around him.
The man is said to have held his stepdaughter captive for five years. Rusa says they were called to the scene after the man was severely assaulted by irate community members last night.
Used condoms were found in the house which prompted the child to be questioned.  The 10-year-old is said to have admitted to being raped since her mother’s death five years ago.
“The child went on to explain that she and her stepfather had moved to Verulam, from Johannesburg, in December, last year. He had sealed all the windows in their home, and held her captive in the house while he was at work.
Rusa issued a report and said: “He also did not enroll her in school so that she would not tell anyone about the rape and abuse she was going through. He had also asked her to sleep with other men to subsidise his income […].”
At about 5.38pm, the man returned from work and was confronted by the angered community.
“When he attempted to flee, he was surrounded and assaulted. Residents entered his home and found several sex toys, lingerie and pornographic videos. The child admitted that the sex toys were used on her,” the report further added.
