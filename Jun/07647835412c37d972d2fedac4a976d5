Modubatse High School learners in GaKgapane, Limpopo, experienced corporal punishment by one of their teachers for making noise in class last Wednesday, Letaba Herald reports.
One of the learners took a video as the scene unfolded, and the video shows that the teacher was using a fan belt to beat them.
The media tried to get a comment from Modubatse High School about the incident. The principal responded: “I don’t have a comment since I didn’t see the video.’’
The department of education said their governance and labour relations will visit the school to investigate the matter.
Corporal punishment is outlawed, and has no place in education.
