In an effort to win the war against pollution and safeguard the environment, the City of Johannesburg will roll out a phased approach to make separation at source mandatory from July 1 for households, Rosebank Killarney Gazette reports.
This is in line with the City of Johannesburg’s goal to change human behaviour and get people to understand how they affect the environment in the way they handle plastic.

This was the message of the City of Johannesburg MMC for environment and infrastructure services Nico de Jager.
On World Environment Day on June 5, De Jager rolled up his sleeves, donned a pair of gloves, put on his overalls and started removing mounds of refuse around the Glenville Primary School in Lenasia.
The MMC said Pikitup introduced the Separation-at-Source Programme in 2009, and although the participation rate is low, Pikitup continues to roll out more recycling programmes.
“Through education and awareness programmes, we have seen an increase in participating residents. From 1 July, a phased approach to make separation at source mandatory will be introduced,” he said.
Between bouts of back-breaking work, De Jager paused and told learners and residents that Joburg was mindful that a sustainable city requires partnerships with all communities to protect the environment and ultimately humanity. “With the community’s involvement, I’m positive this challenge will be effectively dealt with,” he said.
Lungile Dhlamini, the managing director of Pikitup, said illegal dumping and littering cost the City about R60 million a year. He said Pikitup was trying to eradicate illegal dumping spots around Joburg.
“We have around 2 000 known illegal dumping spots within the City. Between July 2017 and now, we have eradicated 110 illegal spots.”
