Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe tweeted today that Eskom would implement stage 1 load shedding from 11.30am until 9pm this evening.
Phasiwe said this was due to the power utility’s power generation units tripping multiple times.


In a previous tweet, Phasiwe said acts of intimidation and sabotage continued today at some of Eskom’s power stations in the wage strike held by unions.
These acts, Phasiwe said, threatened the security of power supply.
“Eskom will continue to provide regular updates about the state of the power system through various media platforms,” he tweeted.


The entity obtained a court interdict against the picketing union members, prohibiting them from intimidating workers and contractors who are not part of the strike, the hijacking of coal trucks and the sabotaging of the power utility’s electricity infrastructure.
