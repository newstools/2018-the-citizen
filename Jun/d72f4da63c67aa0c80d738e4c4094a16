Rohde was arrested after the body of his wife, Susan Rohde, was found hanging by the neck by an electrical cord from a hook behind the bathroom door of the hotel room they shared at the Spier Wine Estate in 2016.
Rohde claims that Susan hanged herself after a fight when she learned he was still having an affair with property industry colleague Jolene Alterskye.
However, the state alleges Rohde strangled his wife and tried to make it look like a suicide.

During his testimony, Rohde told the court that his wife was “furious” on the night of her death after she caught him with Alterskye. He had been convincing Susan that he had stopped seeing her. Susan learned of the affair in February, but believed Jason had ended it.
Rohde said he woke up later to find the bathroom door locked from the inside.
He contacted hotel reception, and a handyman, Desmond Daniels, was sent out and unlocked the bathroom door, behind which was found the body of Susan Rohde.
