DA leader Mmusi Maimane has written to speaker of parliament Baleka Mbete to request that the National Assembly urgently debate the tax levy and levy structure of fuel in South Africa.
The fuel price increased by 82 cents this week, costing R15.54 for inland South Africans and R15.79 for 93 and 95 octane petrol, respectively. Diesel increased by between 85 and 87 cents a litre, depending on the grade.
In the letter, Maimane said the fuel price hike was a “tax attack” adversely affecting the pockets of the poor, working and middle class of the country.
“To this end, I also refer you to the obligation set out in rule 130(8)(c) which states that in exercising your discretion to grant and schedule the debate, you are bound to take into consideration that the matter must be ‘of so serious nature that it requires attention’ or be ‘of sufficient immediate public importance to warrant it taking precedence over programmed business’,” Maimane said.
