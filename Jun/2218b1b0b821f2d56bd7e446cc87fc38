According to reports, the metro police officer was travelling in a taxi when an argument broke out between two passengers.
“The police officer was attempting to calm down both of the passengers,” said KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala.
“The taxi driver pulled over and the two passengers jumped out of the vehicle.”
Gwala said the suspect then drew his firearm and pointed it at the other man.
“At this stage the police officer ordered the suspect to put down his weapon.
“The suspect cocked the firearm, but it jammed as he was pointing it at the officer.
“The officer drew his firearm and fired shots, wounding the suspect in the chest, shoulder and abdomen.
“He was taken to hospital, where he later died,” Gwala said.

He added that the serial number of the 9mm pistol was circulated and came back positive as being stolen in July during an armed robbery in eShowe.
‘The firearm has been sent for ballistic testing to determine whether it was used in the commissioning of other crimes.”
A case of attempted murder, possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition as well as an inquest docket are being investigated by Sydenham SAPS.
