Limpopo police discovered a grisly scene on Sunday morning when they came across two bodies in Uyskraal, reports the Bosveld Review.
The police have subsequently condemned what they described as the continuous incidents of domestic violence in the province.
This follows the deaths of two people in Uyskraal next to the N11 road between Marble Hall and Roedtan on Sunday morning, 3 June. There are suspicions that it could be a case of murder suicide.
According to police spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe, a passerby noticed the body of one person hanging from a tree and summoned police to the scene.
“Police found the body of a 22-year-old woman with bruises around her neck, the body of a 37-year-old man hanging from a tree and a four-month-old baby boy, believed to be the child of either one or both the deceased, playing next to them,” he explained. Ngoepe says the child was found in good condition and taken to a place of safety.
“The motive behind this incident is still unknown but domestic violence cannot be ruled out. The identities of both deceased will be announced as soon as their next of kin are informed,” he added.
