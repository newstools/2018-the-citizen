“We were startled when we received information from concerned commuters about the fraudulent increase.
“As the association, we have not increased any fares and if and when we do we first consult and inform the commuters in time,” he says.
Sithole says they are calling on commuters to refuse to pay the increased fare.
“They must take the registration number of the vehicle and report it to the association’s offices immediately.
“They can also report the driver at Majola Taxi Rank where they will find the Four Plus One committee based at BP Garage. They can also lodge their complaint by calling our offices on 011-815-6240,” he added.
