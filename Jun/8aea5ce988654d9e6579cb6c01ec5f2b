Parliament today urged the police to “leave no stone unturned” in its efforts to find those behind Tuesday night’s killing of a member of parliament (MP) in an attempted hijacking in Roodepoort, Gauteng.
African National Congress MP Sibusiso Radebe was shot in the head and leg after the suspect allegedly demanded his phone.
Radebe was with another person in a vehicle parked in Carbon Street, Lindhaven when two suspects allegedly approached the vehicle and opened fire. His companion managed to escape uninjured.
“The criminal justice system is implored to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the criminal elements responsible for this heinous crime are brought to book,” National Assembly Speaker Baleke Mbete and National Council of Provinces chairperson Thandi Modise said in a statement.
“Parliament extends its heartfelt condolences to Mr Radebe’s family, friends and the African National Congress for this painful loss.”
