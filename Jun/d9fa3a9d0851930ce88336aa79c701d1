Police in Dutywa in the Eastern Cape are appealing for community assistance in tracing 33-year-old Yolisa Bhunga, who went missing from his home at Mputhi Village, in Dutywa, two weeks ago.
Police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha said Bhunga was allegedly kidnapped on Friday, June 8, by two men who accused him of stealing from them.
Manatha said the two suspects, aged 31 and 56, claimed Bhunga ran off while they were still questioning him. Since then, Bhunga has not been seen. The two suspects were arrested, and are expected to appear in the Dutywa Magistrates’ Court on Friday on charges of kidnapping.
