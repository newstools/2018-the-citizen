The Sandton SPCA has released a statement regarding a man dumping the body of his dead dog on a Joburg suburb roadside, saying the man is a leading member of the legal fraternity, working for a well-known law firm in Sandton. 
Jaco Pieterse, general manager for the Sandton SPCA, said his inspectors visited the office of the person to question him about the incident. He was allegedly away on a private matter at the time. 
“During a teleconference held at the law offices, [he] admitted to dumping the carcass of his family dog. He then agreed to meet with SPCA inspectors on his return to Johannesburg next week. 
“The Sandton SPCA is stunned by the behaviour of a leading member of the legal fraternity, and for his carelessness towards a beloved family pet,” said Pieterse. 
“The lack of respect for an animal – even for one who had died – and the lack of respect for legislation, especially by someone who should be upholding the law, leaves us speechless.” 
In a statement sent to the Sandton SPCA from the law firm in question, a spokesperson confirmed that a senior representative of the firm had met the SPCA “at short notice to discuss the incident that is trending on social media”. 
“We discussed the matter with the individual concerned and have satisfied ourselves that this is a personal matter that does not involve the firm,” she said. 
Pieterse concluded, “We understand the individual is cooperating fully with the SPCA. The Sandton SPCA will ensure that justice is served and is in the process of laying criminal charges for illegal dumping in terms of the by-laws of the City of Joburg.” 
The incident has provoked widespread condemnation of the man’s action on social media, after the SPCA posted a video of the dumping on their Facebook page. 
Commentators have criticised the firm for distancing itself from the matter.
