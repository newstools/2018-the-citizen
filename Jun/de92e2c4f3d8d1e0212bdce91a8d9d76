A man was seriously injured during an alleged hijacking attempt on Rudolf Greyling Road in Bloemfontein in the early hours of Sunday morning.
ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene at 2am to find a car in the middle of the road, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said.
“Upon closer inspection paramedics found that one man, believed to be in his 40s, had sustained serious injuries. Paramedics treated the man for his injuries and thereafter transported him to Mediclinic Bloemfontein for urgent treatment.
“It is understood that several men had attempted to hijack the man, causing him to crash into the bridge. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations,” Meiring said.
