SuperSport have downplayed fears over a potential backlash should its “reconciliatory” engagements with Ashwin Willemse fail.
Gideon Khobane, chief executive of the broadcaster, on Tuesday confirmed that the former Springbok wing “declined” to be interviewed or provide any input for the independent investigation into his sensational studio walkout last month.
Advocate Vincent Maleka’s report found no racism had been “manifested” during the incident.
While Naas Botha and Nick Mallett, who were accused of “patronising” remarks during the broadcast that led to the drama, will be seen on television screens again in near future, Willemse’s future remains uncertain.
The 37-year-old is still under contract at SuperSport but his continued reluctance to engage will raise questions over whether the broadcaster has handled the issue effectively, especially as Maleka acknowledges that his report is “impoverished” without Willemse’s input.
“I wouldn’t want to preempt what would happen if we weren’t able to come to an agreement,” said Khobane.
“We’ve been very reconciliatory in our approach because we know what a complex and sensitive issue this is. We, personally, still want to understand how he feels.”
Willemse had indicated through his legal representatives that he felt the independent probe was not an appropriate forum to “redress the infringement on his human rights and dignity”.
“We’ve done what we can as a business in appointing a reputable, independent individual to conduct the review and also referring our report to the Human Rights Commission of South Africa,” said Khobane.
“By continuing to engage with Ashwin, we can also determine what forum he believes would be appropriate.”
SuperSport would be implementing all five recommendations made by Maleka.
