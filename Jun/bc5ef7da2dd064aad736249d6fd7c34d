Police are on the hunt for two lions that are said to be on the prowl in the Ashburton/Camperdown vicinity near Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, reports the Maritzburg Sun.
Initial reports that have come through have indicated that the two lions were spotted crossing the N3 on Wednesday morning in the proximity of the Umlaas Road area.
Constable Ngubo from the Camperdown police station confirmed she had dispatched members to investigate.
“I have sent out a van to check on what is going on as we have received numerous phone calls,” she said.
David McLaren of visiting animal circus McLaren’s confirmed that all their animals were accounted for.
There was no confirmation from the Lion Park, as their phones initially went unanswered.
