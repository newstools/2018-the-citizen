Police are searching for three armed men “after the sergeant who is the protector” of a Gauteng MEC was hijacked while waiting for the MEC in an official vehicle in Johannesburg at about 1pm on Saturday, Gauteng police said.
“It is alleged that three armed men accosted the police officer and pointed [at] him with firearms demanding the car keys. The suspects then drove with the police officer until they dropped him off at Bosmont in Sophiatown. The officer did not sustain any injuries,” Captain Mavela Masondo said on Sunday.
Police had launched a manhunt for the suspects and were on the lookout for a grey Mercedes Benz ML 500. The suspects were believed to be driving a white VW Jetta, Masondo said.
According an EWN report, the hijacked car belonged to sport, arts, culture, and recreation MEC Faith Mazibuko. Her “security detail was waiting by her car” in the Johannesburg CBD to escort her to a meeting when armed men hijacked the vehicle. They then sped away with a security officer inside the car, before dumping him in nearby Bosmont. The incident came just two weeks ago after Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga was hijacked in Midrand, EWN reported.
