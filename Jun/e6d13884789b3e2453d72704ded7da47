Former minister of sport and police Fikile Mbalula, now the ANC’s head of elections, doesn’t seem to be struggling since being axed from cabinet.
He tweeted regularly about his recent trip to Sochi in Russia where he watched Iberian soccer powerhouses Spain and Portugal go head to head in their first group match at the Fifa World Cup.
That game ended in a 3-3 draw, with Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo scoring all three of his side’s goals.
Mbalula is a big sports nut and travelled in first-class style.
He also hung out with South Africa’s most successful coach at the moment, Sundowns’ Pitso Mosimane, as well as one-time Fifa presidential hopeful and fellow ANC bigwig Tokyo Sexwale.
Mbalula has been in Russia since the start of the tournament and also attended the opening ceremony and first match between Russia and Saudi Arabia, which the hosts won.




The ANC’s most popular member on Twitter said Sochi was swelteringly hot.
