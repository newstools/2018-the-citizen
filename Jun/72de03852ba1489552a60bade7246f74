Western Cape police have confirmed that an attack on a mosque in Malmesbury in the early hours of Thursday morning has left three people dead.
Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said two people were stabbed to death and the attacker was killed by police when he refused to surrender.
“Malmesbury police were called out to a local mosque and found two people stabbed to death and several injured. The suspect, believed to be in his thirties and armed with a knife, was still on the scene and charged at the police who tried to persuade him to hand himself over. He ignored the calls and tried to attack police”.
Police shot and killed him on the scene.
Traut said provincial detectives remained on scene.
He said the Independent Police Investigative Directorate will investigate the death of the suspect.
Last month, a mosque in KwaZulu-Natal was attacked in which an imam had his throat slit and two others were viciously stabbed.
