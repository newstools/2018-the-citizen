Someone appears to have gotten a little too comfortable inside a Kulula plane before take off recently.
A Kulula airline passenger delayed takeoff after allegedly calling the pilot the k-word. Another passenger on the plane quickly shot to Twitter to share news of the incident.
A woman speaking to her boyfriend on the phone allegedly called the captain the k-word.  The guy sitting next to her overheard her and alerted the flight attendant before lift off. Security was called to remove the woman.
In a short Tweet, @Nadine_watkins1 wrote:  Turning back to O.R Tambo after an unsavory passenger called the captain the k-word.  Our flight might be 10 minuets late, but as South Africans we can’t allow this type of behaviour to continue.

The airline was lauded for its quick response on the matter.

Well done to #Kulula Airlines for their prompt and proper response to racism.

The airline which prides itself on being South Africa’s most fun airline recently had the president Cyril Ramaphosa as one of their passengers in June.
The airline has also taken former president Jacob Zuma to his destination as a passenger in April.
