South Africans are getting in on the action to rename four airports in the country, Zululand Observer reports.
Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) has given people until June 6 to submit proposals for the renaming of Cape Town, East London, Kimberly and Port Elizabeth airports.
The renaming forms part of the Transformation of Heritage Landscape government programme.
“This will be implemented in terms of the South African Geographical Names Council Act of 1998 (Act No. 118 of 1998) and, therefore, the South African public is requested to forward their proposals to Airports Company South Africa before 6 June 2018,” Acsa said.
Many have heeded the call and shared their suggestions on social media.


Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leaders have expressed their support for Cape Town International Airport to be renamed after late struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.

EFF spokesperson Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said: “Done my part; Rename Cape Town International Airport to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela International Airport. No motivation needed – she is queen.”
Some people on social media site Twitter have also backed the EFF’s call.




Many have, however, rejected the process of renaming, and called for resources to be redirected elsewhere.
