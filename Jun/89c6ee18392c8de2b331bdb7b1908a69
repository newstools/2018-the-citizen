A man in his 30s was killed when he and other people were pushing a broken-down car off the road and another vehicle smashed into them on the N2 south in Durban near NPC Cement at about 2am on Saturday morning, paramedics said.
Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene to find the badly damaged vehicles on the national freeway, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said.
“The man was assessed; however, he had sustained major injuries. There was nothing paramedics could do for the man and he was declared deceased on the scene. Two other occupants had escaped with minor injuries.”
The events leading up to the crash were still unknown, he said.
