Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng addresses the youth at More Than Conquerors Through Christ Ministry in Ebony Park Extension.
“We want to achieve social transformation among the youth, and we want to restore hope while inspiring them,” Motsoeneng said.
Guest speaker Motsoeneng told young people that if you are a leader, people must talk about you – bad or good – but the leader should not entertain gossip.
“When you are a living person, you cannot stop people talking about you. You should not let their gossip define your future. Don’t allow your background decide your future,” said Motsoeneng.
Motsoeneng added young people should stop doubting themselves and rather believe in whatever they want to pursue in life.
“You should believe there is nothing that can stop you. Young women should not depend on men, but they should depend on themselves,” said Motsoeneng.
Members from Kuzondlula Motivational Tour were also part of the event.
