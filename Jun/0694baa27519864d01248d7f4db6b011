MMC for economic development Leah Knott said once the application process is finalised 100 candidates would be chosen to complete the skills and artisan training course.
“Learners graduating from this programme will obtain a NQF Level 3 equivalent or N2 Certificate, and credits obtained can also be utilised in achieving further qualifications,” she said.
Knott said the 12-week programme is integral to the department’s commitment to 5% economic growth and reduction of unemployment in accordance with the City’s service delivery objectives.
“Once their training is completed candidates are required to undertake an apprenticeship of between 12 to 24 months which is dependent on their chosen trade, which the City will assist with.”
Knott said programmes such as these were vital in addressing the skills shortage in our economy, particularly with South African youth.
“This will put our youth in a better position to access opportunities and make inroads towards closing economic gaps within local markets. The shortage of professional artisans remains a challenge particularly in the construction and engineering sectors and this programme aims to properly address this reality.”
