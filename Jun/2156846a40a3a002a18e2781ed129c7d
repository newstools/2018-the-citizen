Trainer Brett Crawford can chalk up another KwaZulu-Natal feature race at Greyville tonight when he delivers a double-fisted attack on the Grade 2 Post Merchants over 1200m.
He saddles Sunset Eyes and Black Cat Back and it would come as no surprise if the pair fight out the finish. Betting World have priced up Sunset Eyes as the 5-2 favourite with Black Cat Back at 4-1. 
On form there is little to choose between the two. In fact, based on their run over this course and distance in March it could be Black Cat Back who could have the edge. However, they met again in the In Full Flight Stakes over 1100m at Scottsville and once again Sunset Eyes proved better than his stablemate, although both were beaten by another of their stable companions, Bold Respect. 
It was Bold Respect who proved best in the Grade 1 Golden Horse Sprint over 1200m at Scottsville although Sunset Eyes ran third.

There is no Bold Respect in this event and the fact stable jockey Corne Orffer has chosen to ride Sunset Eyes who also has the advantage of jumping from No 1 draw, gives one the impression he could be the stable elect.
There is a Pick 6 carryover of R300 000 at the meeting and the pool is expected to reach R1.5 million. One is always hoping for a big payout on these occasions so it could be worth adding in a few other runners. 
Alec Laird would not be sending Pure Blonde if he did not believe this son of Kahal had a chance. He is a 14-1 chance and with Randall Simons in top form it would not be wise to leave him out, even though this will be his first run at the course. 
It will also be interesting to see how Legislate performs in his first official race in two years but if his barrier trial win is anything to go by, he is another who needs to be included.
