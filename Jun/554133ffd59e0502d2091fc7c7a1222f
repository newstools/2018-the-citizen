The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) said today it had charged disgraced former Eskom chief financial officer, Anoj Singh, with misconduct following an extensive period of investigation.
Signh resigned from Eskom in January after being placed on suspension by the power utility in September 2017. This followed allegations he was involved in irregularly awarding contracts to Gupta-linked businesses, and also received gifts and trips from the controversial family.
SAICA said in a statement that Singh had conducted himself in a manner which was “discreditable, dishonourable, dishonest, irregular or unworthy, or which is derogatory to the Institute, or tends to bring the profession of accountancy into disrepute”.
The chartered accountants institute also said Singh had failed to comply with relevant laws and regulations, and to avoid any conduct that he knew or should have known may discredit the accountancy profession.
