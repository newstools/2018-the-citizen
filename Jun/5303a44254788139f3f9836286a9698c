A team of road construction workers in India triggered outrage on social media by laying hot tar over a dog sleeping at the roadside instead of chasing or moving it away.
The team were laying fresh tar on the road from Phool Sayyed Crossing towards Circuit House and the Taj Mahal inÂ  when the incident happened.
Later a road roller crushed the dog and the dead animal was removed from the road by a front-end loader.
A case has been opened againsst those responsible under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.
An angry crowd has also gathered outside the Sadar police in Agra demanding action against the perpetrators.
Locals say the dog was definitely alive when tar was poured over it, but even if it was dead, it should have been removed before the tar was laid, activists insist.
