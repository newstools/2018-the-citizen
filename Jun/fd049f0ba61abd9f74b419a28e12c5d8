National police union Popcru says its fight for better working conditions and wages will include a march to the Union Buildings next month – and a revelation that parliamentary bartenders earn up to R100 000 more annually than junior police officers has only strengthened their resolve. 
A recent advertisement for job vacancies within parliament showed the minimum salary package offered to the House’s bartenders dwarfs what junior police officers earn. 
As a bartender, you would earn at least R283 611 a year (about R23 000 a month). In comparison, says Popcru, police constables earn just R180 000 a year. 
According to the ad, to be a bartender in parliament, you need a Grade 12 qualification, a National Certificate in food and beverage services, computer literacy skills and at least two years of experience. 
South African police union (Sapu) leader Oscar Skomere was also outraged at the revelation this week. 
Skomere said it was unfair that bartenders received so much more money than junior police officers, who worked in dangerous conditions. 
Popcru spokesperson Richard Mamabolo said the union would march in Pretoria on the July 13.
