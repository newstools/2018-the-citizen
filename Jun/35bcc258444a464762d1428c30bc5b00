Many main roads in the Randburg area have been newly resurfaced, ensuring a smoother ride for motorists for years to come, Randburg Sun reports.

Areas where work has already taken place include:

Curzon Road in Bryanston
Hill Street, Republic Road, Kent Avenue, Harley Road, Bramfischer Drive, and Sentrum Road in Ferndale
Malibongwe Drive and Republic Road in Darrenwood
Hans Schoeman Road in Malanshof
Republic Road in Randpark.

According to JRA communication’s Bertha Peters-Scheepers, the estimated time taken to complete the road resurfacing is plus-minus four days per kilometre, with road markings to be painted two weeks after completion.
“This two-week delay for road markings is to allow for the bitumen to age. Otherwise, the paint becomes dull,” Peters-Scheepers said.
Ward 104 councillor Mike Wood added, “As councillors, we are in constant contact with JRA to get other roads resurfaced. I am very thankful for the cooperation from the JRA, they have responded to our requests for the resurfacing of our roads.”
The estimated completion date for the Randburg road resurfacing project is 30 June.
