Heyns started off by telling the youngsters who she was and why she was there. She told her story about when she started swimming at a tender age and how she had to leave home and go train in the US and Canada to become a better swimmer.
“I had a negative mindset when I was away from home, and that didn’t help me at all. I had to change my attitude and be positive so I could move forward,” said Heyns.

The schoolchildren had some questions to ask Heyns. “How did you win?” asked one. Heyns said: “I worked very hard and made sure that I was achieving goals that I set for myself and not competing with or trying to be like others.”
The value she was trying to teach the children was that you could do anything in the world if you put your mind to it.
