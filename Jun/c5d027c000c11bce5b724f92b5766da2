Journalists at the scene have also been threatened by taxi drivers that they will have their cameras taken away or be shot at if they did not leave the scene.
The lower CBD from East Street towards the Brookside taxi rank and the N3 off-ramp is a no-go zone. Motorists are advised to stay away from the CBD.
