Eskom has warned on Thursday that some of its power stations are at risk because of the alleged intimidation of workers who want to go to work while others are engaged in a “shutdown” of the power utility over a wage dispute.
“Intimidation and road blockades are rife at most of Eskom’s power stations and regional offices this morning, a move that might compromise Eskom’s ability to keep the lights on. Eskom will continue to provide regular updates on various media platforms,” Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said.
“Eskom cannot guarantee a secure electricity supply as workers embark on illegal industrial action and planned lunchtime pickets this week. The situation is actually deteriorating very rapidly. People are blockading roads to power stations. Six power stations are at risk.”
Trade unions at Eskom are currently engaged in a shutdown of operations, including at the utility’s headquarters in Megawatt Park, over a wage dispute. Workers are demanding salary increments of up to 15%, while Eskom is offering none.
Eskom said on Wednesday it was considering seeking a court interdict to secure power supply as the labour action continues.
