Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene has re-appointed Mark Kingon as acting commissioner of the South African Revenue Service (SARS) for a further 90 days effective from Sunday, the finance ministry said.
Section 7 of the SARS Act empowered the minister of finance to appoint an acting commissioner. However, the president appointed a permanent commissioner, the ministry said in a statement.


Kingon was appointed as acting commissioner in March following the suspension of Tom Moyane by President Cyril Ramaphosa.
