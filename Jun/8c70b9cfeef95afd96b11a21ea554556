Sardine frenzy – finally – hit the lower South Coast of KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday, Father’s Day, reports the South Coast Herald.

Fishermen netted for more than four hours (and counting) at Ramsgate’s Ski-boat Bay as an estimated 1000 crates were filled.
The crowds flocked in as ‘sardine frenzy’ took over, with South Coasters making the most of what many described as the best run they had seen in many years.
It was the kind of euphoria normally associated with an at-long-last Springbok rugby victory over the All Blacks.






What surprised some is that it has actually been fairly warm in terms of the weather of late, not usually conducive to a sardine run.




The hope was that more would be on the way.
