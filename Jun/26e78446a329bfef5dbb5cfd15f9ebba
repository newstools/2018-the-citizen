A North West farmer’s son accused of murder and attempted murder was cleared of the charges at the High Court in Pretoria today.
The court acquitted Mathew Benson, 24, of the charges following an application by his legal representative to the court under section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act after the State concluded its case last week.
Benson was accused of the murder of Tebogo Ndlovu and attempted murder of Ndlovu’s two friends.
The State alleged Benson fired shots at Ndlovu, 24, and his friends, on August 2, after the trio from Majakaneng, south of Brits, went to the Mooinooi farm intending to steal scrap metal.
Benson allegedly spotted them, chased after them and fired shots at them, allegedly hitting Ndlovu. 
His friends attempted to carry him while fleeing from Benson, but he was too heavy for them and they left him behind under a tree.  He has not been seen since August 2. His friends escaped unharmed.
Majakaneng residents waged a violent protest after Ndlovu went missing.
At least five vehicles were torched and the N4 and R104 between Pretoria and Rustenburg and the R566 road linking Pretoria and Sun City were barricaded.
