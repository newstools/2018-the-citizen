A shop owner, 26, in Port Elizabeth was arrested after he allegedly shot at one of his customers.
Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said it was alleged that a man went to a shop in New Brighton on Tuesday night to buy airtime for his mobile phone.
Beetge said an argument ensued between the man and the shop owner when the client insisted that he did not get the correct amount of change.
“The shop owner drew a firearm and shot one shot at the shopper. Fortunately the shopper was not injured in the incident.”
Police searched the shop and a 7.65 pistol and five rounds of ammunition were confiscated.
The suspect was arrested and charged with attempted murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.
Beetge said the serial number of the firearm was filed off and would now be analysed by forensic and ballistic experts to ascertain if the firearm was used in any other offences, as well as to determine ownership of the weapon.
The suspect will make his first appearance in the the New Brighton Magistrate’s Court tomorrow.
