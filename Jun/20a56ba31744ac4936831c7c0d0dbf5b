Severe rainstorms lashed Cape Town and other parts of the drought-stricken Western Cape overnight, leading to severe flooding in places and hopes that dams in the region would have received a significant boost.
The City of Cape Town’s Disaster Management Centre reported that extensive flooding occurred in the city’s northern suburbs of Goodwood, Parow, Ravensmead, Belhar and Bellville South due to heavy downpours and gale force winds.

The City’s Charlotte Powell said: “Approximately 150 residential properties have been affected. Roofs have been blown off in Sir Lowry’s Pass Village and a few properties have been damaged. Trees have been uprooted in Parow, Goodwood, Constantia and Belhar areas.

“Power lines came down in Goodwood, Parow Valley, Langa, Bergvliet, Durbanville and Maitland areas and mudslides have been reported in the Hout Bay area.”



A law enforcement officer was also hospitalised with slight injuries after a tree fell on a law enforcement vehicle on Constantia Main road.


The City’s recreation and parks department was on Friday morning removing uprooted trees across the metropole to ensure roadways are cleared while the roads and stormwater department is unblocking drains.

Disaster management officials are continuing to do damage assessments in the affected communities.
