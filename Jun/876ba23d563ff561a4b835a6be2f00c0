EFF leader Julius Malema has, in a tweet sent on Wednesday morning, accused the ANC of sexism, saying they have reduced the role of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to one of insignificance because she is a woman.


This follows the ANC embarking on a campaign to have the Cape Town International Airport renamed the Nelson Mandela International Airport.
This comes a week after The Citizen reported the EFF had been lobbying for the airport to be renamed after Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.
In a tweet, now deleted, the party’s official Twitter account, @MyANC, posted this picture:

Despite the Twitter account deleting the tweet, people have saved the picture, and are taking to Twitter to criticise the ANC for the campaign. Some have accused them of copying the EFF, while others feel that the party has honoured Nelson Mandela sufficiently already and should be looking at other names.
The EFF’s official account did not mince words in a series of tweets condemning the ANC campaign.

A public meeting at Cape Town International Airport on Monday to discuss the renaming process descended into chaos and had to be scrapped.
An organisation called Gatvol Capetonian have stated that “Krotoa” or “Saartjie Baartman” are the only acceptable names, and there “will be war if another name is chosen”.
