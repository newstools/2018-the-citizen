The power utility said after 8pm that power had been restored in all areas countrywide, but urged users to use power sparingly.
Earlier, several places experienced a few hours of load-shedding on Thursday night, presumed to be a reaction to protests against Eskom by workers.
Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe had earlier said the load shedding was caused by intimidation and acts of sabotage. He said municipalities would determine which areas would be affected.
Eskom had admitted that South Africa faced a real risk of load-shedding and asked South Africans to lower power consumption in a bid to avoid this.
Power consumption can be lowered by switching off geysers, pool pumps, heaters and non-essential appliances in peak periods.
The utility added it was load-shedding according to published load shedding schedules which were available on the Eskom website (loadshedding.eskom.co.za) or at local municipalities if you were a municipal customer.
Eskom customers can contact customer call centre on 0860 037 566 (08600 ESKOM) for more information.
