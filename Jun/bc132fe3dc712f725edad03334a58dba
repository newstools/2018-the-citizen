In an in-depth interview with the Turkish-based 24-hour news network, the firebrand politician also warned of South Africa descending into an anarchic revolution if things continue the way they have.
“I can’t give you a guarantee of the future,” Julius Malema said. “Especially when things are going the way they are.”
“If things are going the way they are, there will be a revolution in this country. I can tell you now. There will be an unled revolution in this country, and an unled revolution is the highest form of anarchy,” Malema said.
This is not the first time Malema has said he is not calling for the slaughter of white people “for now”.

Speaking to the press after appearing at the Newcastle Magistrates’ Court in 2016 on two charges of violating the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956, Malema said white people were not entitled to any land in South Africa and that for now he was not calling for the slaughter of whites.
“The white man has been too comfortable for too long. We are here unashamedly to disturb the white man’s peace, because we have not known peace. We don’t know what peace looks like. They have been swimming in a pool of privilege. They have been enjoying themselves because they always owned our land,” he said.
“White minorities be warned. We will take our land. It doesn’t matter how. It’s coming, unavoidable. The land will be taken by whatever means necessary.”
