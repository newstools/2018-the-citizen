Former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo turned 50 today.
The African National Congress (ANC) in the North West wished Mahumapelo, who is the provincial chairman of the ANC, well on his 50th.
“We wish him a happy birthday, long life and more strength to continue working hard for the movement as he’s been doing for decades,” said acting provincial chairperson Sussana Dantjie.
“Cde Supra is an important part of the ANC in the province and has contributed enormously – in different roles – in building the party to where it is today. We send him love and appreciation.”
Mahumapelo resigned as the premier of North West on May 23.
The ANC is yet to appoint a premier for North West. Finance, economic and enterprise development member of the executive council (MEC) Wendy Nelson has been appointed the acting premier of the province.
Speaking to his supporters on May 9, after he made a dramatic U-turn on his resignation, Mahumapelo said he would celebrate his birthday on June 7 and on June 8 he would travel to Durban to support former president Jacob Zuma who was due to appear in the Durban High Court on Friday.
Zuma is facing 16 charges stemming from the arms deal almost a decade ago.
