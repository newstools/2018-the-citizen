Outgoing provincial police commissioner Deliwe de Lange says her recent dismissal will not stop her from helping the people of Gauteng.
It was announced this week that de Lange would be taking early retirement and stepping down from her position. At a briefing with MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, de Lange said she would still be an active participant in the fight against crime.
“Policing is a calling for me. Believe me‚ I’m one person who wants to work with my community and wants to work with the people in Gauteng. I will not sit down and rest,” de Lange told the media.
“I don’t need any pay. I just want to be involved to ensure our people can walk freely in the streets, to ensure that perpetrators are brought to book and to ensure people can move around Gauteng without any fear,” she said.
According to a report on TimesLive de Lange was given three options of redeployment from her post, but opted to retire instead. When she asked why she had to leave her position, she was informed the move was linked to rotation and succession planning.
At the MEC briefing, de Lange said that she had not been given any straight answers with regards to her removal.
