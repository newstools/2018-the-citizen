An African People Movers (APM) bus lost control along the N12, near the Xavier offramp, on Tuesday morning.
So far, two people, identified as Lesotho nationals, have lost their lives, and 10 have been injured, IOL has reported.

The bus, which arrived in Johannesburg from Maseru, Lesotho, overturned on the N12 in Johannesburg at about 4am on Tuesday morning, according to JMPD spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar.
“It is alleged that the driver fell asleep, and then the driver went from the N12 east over the barricade and landed on the N12 west in Ridgeway.”


 “Approximately 10 people have sustained serious injuries, including a driver. Two people have died,” Minnaar said.
 Minnaar said at this stage, it is not clear whether the driver had an assistant driver.
 “It seems like [the bus] was going to various location in Gauteng to drop off passengers. Another bus has been called to pick up other passengers who are not injured,” he said.
 Motorists earlier were urged to use Kliprivier and Xavier Street offramp. There was a heavy traffic around where the bus had overturned, as police were clearing the scene.
