Eersterust residents in Pretoria on Wednesday morning protested a lack of service delivery, lack of housing for the poor and constant electricity outages, and one nonparticipating resident got injured by police firing rubber bullets.
According to the woman, police started firing rubber bullets indiscriminately. She claims she was standing outside her house watching the protest, and was not involved herself.
Then one of the rubber bullets hit her in the face, which she handled calmly despite the bleeding gash.

At 3am, the residents had already begun their protest, closing all roads leading into the community, burning tyres and preventing vehicles from leaving the area.
Among those barred from leaving the community were schoolchildren writing midyear exams. Some people’s cars got damaged amid the chaos.
The residents claim they have been forgotten by the government and the City of Tshwane, and it does not matter whether they vote for the DA or the ANC.
They also accused the City of Tshwane of ignoring them, hence the three to four power failures a week.
