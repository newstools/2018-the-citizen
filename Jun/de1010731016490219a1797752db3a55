Food company Tiger Brands said on Tuesday its chief growth officer for consumer brands Grattan Kirk had resigned and would be leaving the company on June 22.
The company, which had to recall processed meat products at its Value Added Meat Products (VAMP) facilities earlier this year after they were linked to a listeriosis outbreak, said Kirk, who joined in 2013, was leaving “to pursue an opportunity in the retail sector”.
Yokesh Maharaj would join Tiger Brands on July 2 as chief growth officer responsible for exports and international, as well as snacks, treats and beverages, the company said.
“Our strategic review identified Africa as a key part of our growth strategy and Yokesh will lead the development and execution of this strategy,” it said.
Pending the appointment of a new chief growth officer for consumer brands, the remainder of the consumer brands portfolio, with the exception of VAMP, would report to the growth officer for grains Pieter Spies, Tiger Brands said, adding that CFO Noel Doyle would assume responsibility for VAMP.
