A man is in a serious condition in hospital after he was hit by a car on the N3 near Durban on Sunday morning, paramedics said.
Netcare 911 responded just before 10am to reports of a pedestrian being knocked down by a vehicle on the N3 northbound just before the Cato Ridge off-ramp, Netcare 911 spokesman Shawn Herbst said.
Reports from the scene indicated that an adult man was knocked down by a car and sustained serious fractures.
The man was treated on the scene by an advanced life support paramedic and then transported to hospital in a stable condition, Herbst said.
