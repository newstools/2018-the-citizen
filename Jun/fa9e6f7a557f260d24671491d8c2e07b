Eskom will not implement rotational load shedding tonight should the low pressure on the electricity grid remain the same, the power utility said.
Eskom last week began implementing load shedding as the electricity grid became constrained due to shortage of power capacity after workers downed tools following a deadlock in wage negotiations.
“Although the possibility of load shedding is low for tonight, the power system continues to remain constrained. Eskom will provide an update on the power system through all media platforms should the status change,” Eskom said.
“Customers who are experiencing power outages today should report the fault via Eskom’s customer contact centre or to their municipality, as this may be a localized power outage.”
Wage negotiations will resume tomorrow and continue until Thursday in Johannesburg after the power utility took the zero percent wage offer off the table.
Eskom advised its customers to keep checking their load shedding schedules on the Eskom and their municipal website, and plan on the assumption that load shedding will take place.
