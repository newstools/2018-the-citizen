The National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) on Friday rejected Eskom’s decision to engage in an arbitration process on the current wage dispute with workers’ unions, saying such a decision was made without consulting them.
The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and Solidarity are currently embroiled in a dispute over the freezing of wage increases by Eskom this year. Wage negotiations collapsed last week, and unions walked out, and the matter had been referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).
Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said all the unions had elected to do a referral of a dispute of interest to the CCMA.
“Numsa, NUM and Solidarity have unanimously agreed to do a referral of a dispute of interest which should be conciliated. We have not been consulted on any arbitration process and we regard this open unilateralism as nothing less than the old union bashing attitude,” Hlubi-Majola said.
“We expect, like any other dispute, that this dispute will be conciliated and a certificate of nonresolution should be issued. In case a settlement is not reached, and all our organisational rights are reserved.”
Eskom obtained a court interdict on Thursday night to prevent workers from striking and disrupting both power and coal supplies.
The power utility on Friday commenced with Stage 1 load shedding, saying this will continue until 9pm due to the impact of the current protest action by some Eskom employees at various sites.
