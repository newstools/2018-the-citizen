The arrest followed an incident at Sterkfontein farm on Friday, Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said.
A 70-year-old farmer was attacked by four armed men who took him to his house where they robbed him of jewellery, four firearms, a Ford Ranger bakkie and an undisclosed amount of cash, before fleeing the scene.
