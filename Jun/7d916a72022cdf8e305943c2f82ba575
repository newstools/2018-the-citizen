The trial against two North West farm workers accused of killing a teenager in Coligny resumes in the North West High Court in Mahikeng on Monday.
The trial was postponed on Friday after a state witness fell sick.
Bonakele Pakisi, 28, was being cross-examined by the defence when he fell sick, and Judge Ronnie Hendricks postponed the trial to Monday to allow Pakisi time to recuperate.
Pakisi claimed he saw Matlhomola Jonas Mosweu thrown from a moving van, allegedly by farm workers Pieter Doorewaard, 26, and Phillip Schutte, 34. Doorewaard was the driver while Schutte allegedly threw Mosweu out of the van.
The pair claim they were taking Mosweu to the police in Coligny after they found him stealing sunflower in their employer’s field.
According to them, Mosweu jumped out of the van, but Pakisi claimed Mosweu was pushed out of the moving vehicle.
Doorewaard and Schutte are facing charges of murder, intimidation, kidnapping, unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, theft and pointing of a firearm.
The State alleges the two killed Mosweu, 16, on April 20, 2017, at Scotland informal settlement in Coligny after accusing him of stealing sunflower from their employer Pieter Kasten’s field at the Rietveli farm.
The State further charged that the two intimidated, kidnapped and stole the cellphone of Pakisi. He was also pointed with a firearm.
The two are out on R5,000 bail each.
Mosweu’s death triggered violent community protests that left a trail of destruction in the small maize growing town and divided the town along racial lines.
