The Tshwane central cluster police have warned of people in Pretoria who tricked motorists to stop in order to hijack their cars, Pretoria East Rekord reports.
Spokesperson Captain Jan Sepato said the hijackers convinced motorists that their tyres were flat to get them to stop.

“The hijackers will signal that you have a flat tyre and when you stop to investigate they would pull up next to you as if they want to help,” he said.
“They will then take your vehicle and drive off, leaving you stranded.
“They targeted male drivers.”
He advised motorists to be careful and avoid stopping, especially in remote locations.
“If you are signalled to stop, especially at a very remote and deserted place, do not stop.

“Drive to the nearest garage or police station where you can get assistance and there will be people there to see you.”
He said there was an increase in the modus operandi on the N1 near the Phumlani Plaza toll gate and on the N4 toward Hatfield in the past two months.
