Two men, suspected of killing father of two Kelly Chetty, were shot dead in a botched hijacking in Avoca earlier this morning, reports Overport Rising Sun.
Police have also recovered the vehicle, which was hijacked on Prince Umhlangane Road, yesterday afternoon.
According to reports received, a shootout ensued in KwaMashu, which led to the suspects being fatally shot. Greenwood Park SAPS spokesperson Sergeant Vincent Mthembu confirmed the incident.
Reports indicate that Chetty was with his children in the car when the tragic incident occurred. It is believed the children were unharmed.


Mthembu said the suspects robbed a vegetable market shop in the vicinity before targeting Chetty’s vehicle.
“The suspects robbed a market that sells vegetables before shooting the victim dead. They then stole another vehicle and used it  as a getaway vehicle,” he explained.
Crisis Medical paramedics and Marshall Security arrived at the scene to find the father of two seated in his Volkswagen Golf R, having sustained a 9mm calibre gunshot wound to the left arm and chest. He was found in a state of cardiac arrest.
According to a report issued, numerous advanced life support interventions were attempted as paramedics from Crisis Medical and Netcare 911 worked fervently for more than 45 minutes, with Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation efforts. However, they were unsuccessful, and the victim was declared dead at the scene.
A report by Crisis Medical stated that an armed suspect fired a shot from the front passenger side of the vehicle, striking the victim. The children, although severely traumatised, were not harmed in the ordeal.
