The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) on Wednesday accused the Emfuleni local municipality in Gauteng province of wasting water worth nearly R122 million by not fixing burst pipes, among other failures.
DA member of the provincial legislature Kingsol Chabalala said Gauteng member of the executive council Uhuru Moiloa, whose ruling African National Congress (ANC) party runs the municipality, had acknowledged the loss of water between July and December last year.
“These water losses could have been avoided by fixing water leakages, monitoring water pipes and as well as urging residents to report burst water pipes,” Chabalala said.
“These millions lost as a result of water loss could have been used to pay the debt that the municipality owes to Rand Water.”
