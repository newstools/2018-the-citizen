The Johannesburg Magistrates’ Court found Thomas Mphela, a 49-year-old male, guilty of rape.
He was accused of raping a 25-year-old mentally ill female in 2016, Randburg Sun reports.
According to Johannesburg Central Police Station’s spokesperson Captain Xoli Mbele, on the day the offence occurred, the convicted rapist visited the home of the victim in Westbury.
Mphela, the victim and the victim’s caregiver were seated together, watching TV.
“The caregiver went to fetch washing on the line, and when she returned, she found the accused on top of the victim. She screamed and he jumped off the victim and left the house,” Mbele said.
A case was opened, and Mphela was arrested two days later. He was denied bail, and has been in custody until his conviction and sentence.
He was sentenced to life imprisonment and the court also declared him unfit to possess a firearm.
Mbele said the good conviction is the result of diligent work done by investigating officer Sergeant Petronella Mathevula.
He added Johannesburg Central police would continue to do their best through their investigation to ensure that those who commit acts of crime against women and children are put away for a long time.
