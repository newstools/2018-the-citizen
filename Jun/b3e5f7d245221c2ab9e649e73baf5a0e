The Mpumalanga government has decided to deploy armed guards to all provincial hospitals and public healthcare centres in the province, the Ridge Times has reported.
These include the provincial hospitals in Bethal and Evander, as well as the local clinics.
According to Joseph Mabuza of the legislature’s communication directorate, this decision was made after a number of robberies that took place in various health facilities over the past few months.




The latest incident occurred last month at the Mapulaneng Hospital in Bushbuckridge, where a doctor was nearly shot by robbers at the doctor’s residence.
