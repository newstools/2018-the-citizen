Nominees this year include Mi Casa, Shekhinah and Prime Circle. Legends Mbongeni Ngema, Steve Kekana and Spokes H will be honoured with lifetime achievement awards.
Hosts for this year are TV and radio personality Dineo Ranaka, comedian Mpho Popps and all-round star Somizi Mhlongo, back for his third year.

Somizi, whose third stint means he holds the record for the most times as host, says that this will be his last year as host, adding that he wants to go out with a bang.
He took to Instagram to promise his fans an unforgettable performance.
“This year is definitely my last time hosting. I’m pulling all stops. I’m giving my all. I’m not holding back,” the colourful celebrity said.
This year’s awards have been dogged by controversy after it was revealed that two nominated acts would have their nominations revoked.

Not long after the nominees were announced, the Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA) released a statement saying that Tigi by Sands which was nominated in the Record of the Year category and Lake by the Ocean by Mobi Dixon which was up for Best Remix had been struck off the nominees list.
Sands was disqualified because he is not a South African citizen, hailing instead from Swaziland, while Mobi Dixon was removed from the list as he was nominated for a remix of an international song.
Some took to social media calling this unfair, as DJ Sbu won in 2011 for Remember When It Rains, a remix of a song by US artist Josh Groban.
The 24th SAMAs will be aired on SABC1, Saturday at 20:00.
