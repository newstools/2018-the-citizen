According to sources, the pastor allegedly picked up the teenager from his house and took him for prayer services to other people’s houses.
“He would then park the vehicle in various places in the Montford area and touch the boy’s penis. He also told the boy that he needs to have sex with him. The incident happened on several occasions before the boy spoke about it,” said the source.
According to the Chatsworth SAPS’s Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Unit’s commander, Colonel Ellappen, the pastor was arrested from his home and subsequently charged for sexual assault.
He is due to appear in the Chatsworth Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday.
Ellappen stressed that crimes against children were a serious issue and would not be tolerated.
“We will ensure that perpetrators face the full might of the law. If any child is exposed to any sexual experience [by an adult], this must be reported to authorities,” he added.
Any adult who is aware of the sexual exploitation of children is compelled to report it to the police in terms of Section 54 of the Sexual Offences Act 32 of 2007.
