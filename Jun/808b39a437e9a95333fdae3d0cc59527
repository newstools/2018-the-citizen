A 31-year-old man was sentenced to life in prison by the Stellenbosch regional court for housebreaking and raping a 32-year-old woman, Western Cape Police said on Friday.
According to police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut, Xolisa Komanisi broke into the house of the victim in Nkanini in 2016 and raped her twice before fleeing.
The case was investigated by the Stellenbosch Family Violence, Child Protection, and Sexual Offences (FCS) unit until he was arrested three months later. He has since spent his days behind bars until his sentence was delivered.
“Crimes against women and children are on top of our priority list in this province and we will not allow perpetrators to go unpunished,” Traut said.
