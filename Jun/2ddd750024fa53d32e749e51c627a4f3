The cost of damages is estimated at R8 million after three train carriages were gutted by a blaze at Steenberg Station in Cape Town on Monday.
An arson docket has been opened. The train is reported to have pulled into the station while on fire on Monday at about 2.50pm.
The City of Cape Towns Fire and Rescue Services were alerted, and they have since confirmed the fire. The train was en route to Fish Hoek.
No injuries have been reported.


About 16 firefighters were on the scene extinguishing the fire. Metrorail spokesperson Richard Walker reportedly said the railway line needed to find the motive behind the attack to identify why the culprits vandalised the coaches and set trains alight.
The damaged carriages were taken to a depot for further investigation and assessment by the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) loss adjusters.
Metrorail has made an appeal for anyone with information regarding the arson to assist the police. A R25 000 reward has been offered to whoever can provide information that will lead to a successful conviction.
 
 


The attack at Steenberg Station follows the alleged torching of three trains in Cape Town in May. The arson attacks occurred at Retreat Railway and Ottery stations. One person died after a blaze broke out in a carriage near Ottery Station.
