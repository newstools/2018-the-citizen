The World Economic Forum (WEF) said on Friday it would convene a one-day roundtable later this month with President Cyril Ramaphosa, ministers and business leaders from across the world about the role of business in shaping an inclusive and sustainable agenda for South Africans.
Elsie Kanza, head of regional strategies and member of the executive committee at WEF, said South Africa must take advantage of the changes in the global economy and build partnerships and collaboration with partners around the globe to ensure prosperity in the future.
“The global economy is about to go through a seismic change as a result of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. South Africa’s leaders from government and business have a window of opportunity to design a better future for the country based on fairness and sustainability,” Kanza said.
The roundtable will lay a foundation for South Africa’s Investment Conference later this year, and design a roadmap to build up to the next World Economic Forum on Africa to be held in South Africa in June 2019.
