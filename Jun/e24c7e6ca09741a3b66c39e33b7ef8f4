The workers were horrified when they turned up for work on Monday to be told that health and safety regulations on the site prohibited them from wearing shorts.
In the 26° Celsius heat they found it really uncomfortable wearing jeans.
But when it dawned on them that, thanks to gender equality regulations, they could get around the ban by wearing women’s clothing, the lads all decided to show up for work next day in skirts and dresses.

“We realised that, as there were women working in offices on the site in skirts, they couldn’t stop us doing the same,” one of them said.
Some raided their better halves’ wardrobes while others went shopping.
Bearded Simon Miles, 45, wore his wife’s denim skirt while bodybuilder Adam Houdire, 29, opted for an above-the-knee leopard print he picked up for a song at a local store.
“I love it,” Adam said. “It gives me more freedom.”
Simon was wolf-whistled by a man on his way to work. “I’ve never had one of those before,” he said with a grin.
