While the leader of the Congress of the People (Cope), Mosiuoa Lekota, no doubt had the best of intentions when he and his party publicised their donation to a needy football team, they clearly weren’t prepared for the reaction.
Many took to social media after they saw the photos of Lekota handing over three soccer balls to the Computer Stars Football Club in Mandela Park, Ladybrand, in the Free State.
Some found it extraordinary that the party could make such a big fuss about such a small donation, with many critics pointing out that the balls did not even look high quality, while some suggested they’d actually been purchased at a bargain price from Shoprite.

EFF leader Julius Malema also mocked his fellow parliamentarian, saying Lekota was responding to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Thuma Mina call.






Cope saw a dramatic drop in support from the dizzy heights of its founding. The party only scraped its way to three National Assembly seats in the last election, a huge drop from their debut of 7.4% of the vote, which gave them 30 seats.
Perhaps if Computer Stars had been around in the glory days, they may have qualified to get another soccer ball and maybe even a shirt or two.
