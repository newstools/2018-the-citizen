In March last year, Black Coffee revealed plans to build a school for artists with designer Laduma Ngxokolo and artist Nelson Makamo. While this seems like massive undertaking in itself, it seems that the DJ has bigger plans than that.
In an interview with Billboard, Black Coffee has revealed that the artists academy in only part of a plan to build an entire neighbourhood for musician, designers and other artists to collaborate in.
“We’ve been working on building a music, art and fashion school in a deserted part of Johannesburg as a collaboration between myself and fellow South Africans artist Nelson Makamo and clothing designer Laduma Ngxokolo with the hope of turning the neighbourhood around,” Black Coffee told Billboard.
“Once the school project is complete, with our partners we endeavour to take this even further and establish an entire neighbourhood. Virgil [Abloh] and leading South African architecture firm SAOTA are helping us with the design of the institution,” he said.
“The opportunities and spaces will offer cultural experiences, boutique stores, restaurants and a learning centre.”
Black Coffee said that ultimately the plan is to establish a community of artists and a strong nightlife ecosystem to support them and their creations. If this project takes off, Maboneng, Braamfontein and Newtown just may have a little competition for Johannesburg’s creative community.
