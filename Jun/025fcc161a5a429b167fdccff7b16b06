“[The] ANC in Bokone Bophirima mourns the death of another councillor, Cde Gloria Pencil. She collapsed at home and passed on,” said acting provincial secretary Sussana Dantjie.
She said Pencil was deployed as a ward 7 councillor at the Lekwa-Teemane local municipality.
“She has been an active member of the ANC, a hardworking volunteer and has been a Ward Councillor since 2006 until her untimely death yesterday [Thursday].”
