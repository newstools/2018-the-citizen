The national power system will be severely constrained between 5pm and 10pm on Saturday, state power utility Eskom said.
“Eskom calls on all consumers to assist by reducing their electricity consumption to minimise the risk of load shedding by switching off geysers, electric heating, pool pumps, and all non-essential appliances tonight [Saturday] from 5pm to 10pm,” Eskom said in a statement.
In the event that load shedding becomes necessary, Eskom and municipalities will use published load shedding schedules. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact the customer contact centre at 0860-037-566.
