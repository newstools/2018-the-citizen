The release of AKA’s much-hyped new album, Touch My Blood, has sent his fans into a frenzy on social media.
Some fans have declared today “Touch My Blood Day”, with attempts from his fanbase, nicknamed the Megacy, to get hashtags such as #TouchMyBloodDay, #Megacy and #TouchMyBlood trending.
One AKA stan even suggested his fellow superfans submit a proposal for Cape Town International Airport to be renamed after the rapper.
Super Mega, as he is known to his supporters, has called this his most introspective album yet. He recently released ‘Beyonce’, which almost “broke the internet”, as he predicted in the lyrics, with its personal lyrics looking at his breakup with Bonang Matheba.
His third full-length album, or fourth, if you include 2017’s Be Careful What You Wish For, a collaboration with Anatii, Touch My Blood features collaborations with artists including Burna Boy, L-Tido, Kwesta and Okmalumkoolkat.
The album has seen very enthusiastic reviews so far, particularly from his die-heard fanbase.
However, not everyone likes it. Here is The Citizen’s review.
