An unknown man was shot dead by Port Elizabeth police after he pointed his firearm at police officers on Wednesday.
Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said the incident unfolded during the early hours of Wednesday morning in KwaZakhele.
Police were patrolling Seyisi Street in New Brighton when they spotted two suspicious men, Beetge said.
“One suspect pointed a firearm at the members and the members fired shots at him, fatally wounding him. The other suspect, a 24-year-old male, was arrested by the members a few metres away. He was identified as a wanted suspect in a Mount Road case of theft out of motor vehicle since August 2018.”
Police recovered a gas-operated pistol and stolen items from a robbery the pair allegedly carried out minutes earlier.
Beetge said while on the scene, a 25-year-old complainant came forward to open a case of robbery.
He identified the goods as his belongings robbed from him on the same street by the same suspects at about 12.30am.
Police are investigating a case of armed robbery, and have opened an inquest.
The 24-year-old suspect is expected to appear in the New Brighton Magistrates’ Court on June 14.
