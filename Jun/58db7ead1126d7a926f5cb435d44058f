Two men were found injured after the car they were travelling in veered off the N8 and rolled at De Brug in the Free State on Sunday, paramedics said.
ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find a car on its roof in a field on the side of the road, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said.
“The two men were found lying outside their vehicle. Paramedics assessed the patients and found that one man had sustained numerous injuries and was in a critical condition while the other man sustained serious injuries.”
Paramedics treated the two men with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, the critically injured man was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to a nearby hospital while the second man was transported by ambulance. The local authorities were on the scene for further investigations, Meiring said.
