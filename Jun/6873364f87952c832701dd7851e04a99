The R8 billion budget of the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality is not enough to meet the service delivery needs of the city, mayor Xola Pakati said today.
Tabling the State of the Metro Address in East London, Pakati said the budget would not address the service delivery backlog in the metro.
He said the inward migration of people from the rural areas to East London remained a problem, causing a backlog of the delivery of electricity, water and roads infrastructure.
“Seemingly, there is no plan on how to manage the influx of the rural communities but we have managed to stabilize the situation,” said Pakati.
He said the metro was collaborating with the departments of economic development and trade and industry to help with the the revitalization of industrial areas within East London.
“The city has contributed R3 million, the Economic Development Department R12 million and the Trade and Industry department R50 million towards the revitalization,” he added.
Pakati also bemoaned service delivery protests taking place in the municipality’s areas.
“Some are so violent, for example, you can’t set government property alight because you have grievances which can be addressed and solved, you can’t burn a clinic if you want a library,” he said.
