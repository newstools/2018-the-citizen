According to the police, they also confiscated the taxi.
The suspect faces charges of culpable homicide, failing to report an accident, failing to stop after the accident and failing to attend to the injured person after the accident.
The suspect appeared in court today, June 19. He was released on R500, and is due to appear in the Thembalethu Magistrates’ Court again on July 25.
Following this incident, residents gathered in Tabata Street calling for the George Municipality discourage speeding vehicles in the street, and to put up street signs and speed humps.
When the George Herald visited the scene yesterday, it looked like trenches were dug in the streets as a means to curb speeding.
