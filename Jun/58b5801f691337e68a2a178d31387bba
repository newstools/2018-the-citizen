Protesting residents in Motherwell in Port Elizabeth took to the streets on Wednesday, burning tyres and blockading roads.
Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said about 100 residents barricaded the Addo Road in various locations up to the intersection of the R335 and R334 in Motherwell.
Angry residents are said to be unhappy about electricity supply in the area, which has been irregular since last Friday.
Beetge said police on the scene were diverting traffic.
“At about 9.30am four municipal vehicles including a truck, a VW Caddy and two bakkies were damaged by an unknown amount of suspects at the Municipal Depot in R335, Motherwell. Damages range from broken windows to batteries being stolen. Value undetermined.”
Police are appealing to road users to make use of alternative routes for their own safety.
Meanwhile, protest action also erupted on Wednesday morning on the Malabar back road towards Gelvandale.
Police blocked the road with traffic being diverted.
