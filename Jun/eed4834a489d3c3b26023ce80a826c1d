A short video clip of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau having an “eyebrow malfunction” has been trending this week, with many news sites reporting that he wears fake eyebrows.
In the clip below it looks as though his left eyebrow has lost its attachment to his face. Numerous memes and even a Twitter account have been created in response.
Snopes.com, however, investigated the video and concluded that it was simply a trick of the light and the leader of Canada does not wear fake eyebrows.
Nevertheless, many mainstream news outlets were fooled. Take a look below for yourself. In the second video, however, you’ll see that from other angles his eyebrow actually looks fine, but is just busier and bushier lower down.

Justin Trudeau wears fake eyebrows… that fell off after he met with Trump st G-7.

Just so you know, yes it's true. Justin Trudeau wears fake eyebrows and takes really good care of us most of the time. But he's really intimidated by @realDonaldTrump, and the sweat loosened the glue that keeps us attached. No biggie

I will never forgive Twitter for making me Google “Justin Trudeau eyebrows” at 2 a.m.

Might be better to use magic-marker next time, instead of glued on eyebrows…#Trudeau #EyebrowGate #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/rTzZhVdDax

This could have been the day that Trudeau became a world leader but his fake eyebrows ruined it.

What about these ones? I could rock these brows to show I respect ones culture and attempt to spread diversity across the free world. This could work. What do you think? pic.twitter.com/YNiyprN3dV
