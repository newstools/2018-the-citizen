Former DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko has expressed her “fondness” for President Cyril Ramaphosa. This followed a tweet thanking ANC elections head Fikile Mbalula, who she affectionately called Razzmatazz, for inviting her to an ANC function that saw academics and professionals in conversation with Ramaphosa at the IDC auditorium in Johannesburg on Thursday night.
The tweet led to speculation on whether Mazibuko, currently a public speaker and member of London-based nonpartisan political organisation Apolitical Academy, might be considering joining the ANC.
Mazibuko resisted these rumours, saying that despite her fondness for Ramaphosa, who she backed publicly as her favoured choice for ANC leader and SA president, that “does not mean that I support or wish to join the ANC”.
In 2014, Mazibuko left politics and obtained a master’s degree in public administration from Harvard University.
Once known for taking on President Jacob Zuma in parliament over various issues, Mazibuko left her position to study, a surprise move that confounded expectations that she would replace Helen Zille as the leader of the DA.
