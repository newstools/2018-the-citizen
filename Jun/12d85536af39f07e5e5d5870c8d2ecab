A man who reported his wife missing last week has been arrested for her murder.
Brooklyn police spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach says police arrested Prem Emmanuel Basdeo (58) today for the murder of his wife Dawn Basdeo (57).
He appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court today and was charged with defeating the ends of justice and perjury for lying in his initial statement.
Dawn was last seen on June 8 at her home in Brooklyn, Pretoria. Missing person information filed was that she left her house around 9am on the day and never returned.
It was her husband who reported her missing on the same evening.
A breakthrough in the case was made on Sunday evening when a silver grey 2007 Mercedes ML63 was found abandoned in Soweto. The car was allegedly used by Dawn at the time of her disappearance.
Emmanuel’s case was postponed to June 12.
Police are still looking for Dawn’s body.
