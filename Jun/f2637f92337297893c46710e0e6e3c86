The road between Lethabong and Rustenburg in North West has been cleared and opened for traffic following the early morning protest in the area.
Traffic was interrupted in Lethabong on Tuesday because of protest action as residents of Lethabong Gardens barricaded the road leading to Rustenburg with rocks and logs, demanding electricity, water and roads.
Buses transporting workers to the mines around Rustenburg were unable to leave, while taxis used the Bethanie Road near Brits, travelling an extra 95 kilometres to reach Rustenburg and others used roads going through the area.
The protest had started on Monday, but the roads were cleared to enable traffic to flow, although some mineworkers were prevented from going to work.
The protest also affected learners attending schools in Lethabong and surrounding areas.
Police were monitoring the situation.
