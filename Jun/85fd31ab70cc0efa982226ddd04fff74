North West province – and the rest of the country – will know on Thursday who has been chosen as successor to Supra Mahumapelo, who stepped down as premier almost a month ago.
The strife-torn province’s new leader will be sworn in on Friday, according to the Judge President of the High Court in Mahikeng.


The ANC National Working Committee is expected to announce the name of the new premier on Thursday, eNCA reports.
The party’s National Executive Committee met yesterday but failed to reach a conclusion. 
Mahumapelo resigned on May 23, following weeks of violent protests against his leadership amid corruption allegations. 
Since then, the ANC’s national leadership has struggled to come to an agreement with the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) over who should take over the reigns in the deeply divided province.
