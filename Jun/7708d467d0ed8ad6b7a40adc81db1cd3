Football legend Diego Maradona is in the center of controversy. The footballer in Russia for the Argentina against Iceland match  is said to have stunned witnesses with a gesture he made to fans.
South Korea fans were reportedly shouting Maradona’s name in admiration.  Maradona obliged with a smile, kiss and a wave, then pulled his eyes to the side in what is reported to be a racist gesture.
ITV’s respected broadcaster Jacqui Oatley tweeted: “Maradona not so cool now.




Argentina against Iceland ended in a deadlock at 1 – 1 with Lionel Messi missing a penalty in the second half.
Maradona is infamously known for the ”hand of God,” a goal Maradona scored using his hand to score in Argentina’s 2-1 quarter-final victory against England during their 1986 World Cup-winning campaign.
The football great has admitted to another crucial handball in the 1990 tournament.
