The three children who were reported missing in the Tzaneen area have been found unharmed and have been re-united with their parents, Limpopo police said on Sunday.
“These children were found in one of the family members’ home at Mogoboya village,” Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said.
Earlier, Ngoepe said police in Maake outside Tzaneen, in conjunction with other role-players, had launched a massive search operation for three children who went missing at Lephepane village between 4pm and 8pm on Saturday.
It was believed that the children left their home village of Lephepane to visit their aunt at Mogoboya village, about 15km from their home. The route “passed a mountain” and they never arrived, Ngoepe said.
Later on Sunday, Ngoepe said: “It is alleged that on their arrival at the aunt’s house they proceeded to another family member’s house to watch TV, and they ended up sleeping there without informing the aunt and other family members until they apparently heard that the police search operation for them was on.
“The matter is now regarded as closed. The South African Police Service condemns in the strongest possible terms poor child safety.”
“Members of the community are once more advised and encouraged to take care of their children in full. Child safety must always come first at all times to prevent this type of incidents to happen, because you cannot allow such young children to walk for a distance of 15 kilometres alone and that is uncalled for and it must not be allowed by any parent or guardian,” Ngoepe said.
