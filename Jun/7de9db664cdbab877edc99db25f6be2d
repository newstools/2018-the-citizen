The Sunday Times reports that the official opposition is so desperate to repair its “battered image” that it has employed a “top international political strategist” from the UK.
Sir Lynton Crosby was paid £4 million by the Conservative party last year, though that did not help them much and they lost some of their support in a snap election following the Brexit referendum.
The party is apparently divided about getting rid of the Australian-born strategist following his “disastrous” campaign. He has been criticised for masterminding controversial right-wing campaign messages that speak against, for example, immigration. He’s worked in several countries, including Canada and New Zealand.
The Democratic Alliance is looking for ways to get back on track ahead of next year’s elections amid a nasty public battle with Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille, the unpopularity of Western Cape premier Helen Zille’s views on colonialism and reports of disunity in the party about issues of transformation.
DA insiders told the paper Crosby met with “senior party leaders” two weeks ago and, although they could not get official comment about it, the party did not deny his involvement.
