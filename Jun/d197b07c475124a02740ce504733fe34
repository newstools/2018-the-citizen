A Nigerian man has left many in shock after he buried his father in a brand-new BMW.
The man from Ihiala in Nigeria shocked locals with the unusual choice of coffin for his father.
A picture of the burial has gone viral on social media. It shows mourners around the luxurious BMW during the apparent burial ceremony. It’s unclear if this is in fact real, though West Africa is known for its extravagant funerals and coffins.
According to reports, the man – identified only as Azubuike – lost his father and honoured him with the vehicle as a coffin.
The generous act has divided opinion on social media, with some even vowing to dig up the luxurious gift and drive off with it.
