“The man then allegedly turned towards the vigilant motorist’s car, pulled out a firearm and pointed it at her. The complainant alerted a security officer who happened to be around there. The officer gave chase, and the suspect was eventually arrested. He was found in possession of a toy gun.
“The police will profile the suspect to try and find out whether he is involved in other crimes in the area or elsewhere.” He said the police were working on the matter and the suspect would appear in court soon.
“The police are grateful that we still have community members who care about helping the police to combat crime in the area,” Molefe said.
