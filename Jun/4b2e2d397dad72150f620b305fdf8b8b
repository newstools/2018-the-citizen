President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday announced his appointment of the country’s former deputy chief justice, Dikgang Moseneke, to lead the mediation team of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) peace facilitation process in Lesotho.
It’s only a few months since he headed the inquiry into the Life Esidimeni crisis, but Moseneke is already taking on this new task.
“President Ramaphosa has appointed Justice Moseneke as the Leader of the Mediation Team consisting of three Deputy Ministers, namely Mr Mohamed Enver Surty of Basic Education, Ms Makgabo Regina Mhaule of International Relations and Cooperation and Ms Ellen Molekane of State Security,” a statement from the Presidency said.
The decision is in line with a decision taken at the SADC Double Troika Summit in April this year when it was decided Ramphosa would continue his role to facilitate political dialogue and reform processes in the Kingdom and appoint a high-profile personality to assist him.
Ramaphosa said Moseneke’s experience and expertise in constitutionalism would assist the process.
“I take this opportunity to thank Justice Moseneke for availing himself to support us in this important mandate as we continue to assist our brothers and sisters in the Kingdom of Lesotho in their search for a lasting and sustainable solution to their political and security challenges,” Ramaphosa is quoted as saying in the statement.
