Three alleged drug dealers appeared in the Zwelitsha Magistrate’s Court today for dealing in drugs, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (better known as the Hawks) in the Eastern Cape said.
Hawks spokesperson Captain Anelisa Feni said Lungisa Makhapela, 41; Nomaxabiso Gushu, 37; and Simphiwe Mpela, 37, were arrested on Tuesday after crime intelligence, the South African Police Service (SAPS) Tactical Response Team and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals acted on a tip-off about alleged drug dealing at a house in Zwelitsha.
“Three hundred Mandrax tables, 243 pipes allegedly used for smoking Tik, a drug weighing machine, cash to the value of approximately R11 000 and four dogs was recovered during the arrest,” said Feni.
The case was postponed to June 27 for a formal bail application.
