A discussion around concerns about a new party that appears to be mobilising around former president Jacob Zuma is likely to take place at the ANC’s special national executive committee (NEC) meeting in Irene, Tshwane, on Monday, a reliable source has told The Citizen.
The NEC, according to the Mail & Guardian, is reportedly also planning to discuss how to prohibit and take action against members who drag the party to court.
ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe told The Citizen on Saturday morning he could not confirm what would be on the agenda for Monday’s meeting.
A national working committee member had earlier told The Citizen the ANC’s top six have discussed concerns around reports that Zuma is being wooed by members of a new party, the African Transformation Congress (ATC), which believes the former president is being mistreated by the ANC and want him to become the face of the ATC.
The ANC has banned its members from, among other things, appearing in support of Zuma at his corruption trial wearing ANC colours and in their capacity as ANC members.
Zuma has distanced himself from the new formation, though many insist that he has secretly given the ATC his blessing. There has, however, been no clear evidence of that and Zuma has insisted he remains loyal to the ANC.
The source went as far as to suggest the ANC’s top six are divided on whether Zuma should lose his ANC membership in the wake of the ATC’s formation, saying that four of the six are allegedly in favour of this outcome.
When called for comment, Mabe said there was no truth to the story, and alleged it was being said as part of ongoing efforts by some in the ANC to attempt to sow division in the ANC and to foment anger among ANC members in, particularly, KwaZulu-Natal.
ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule also denied that the party leadership has been contemplating Zuma’s expulsion.
“There is no such thing,” he said on Saturday, after initially saying he was not in a position to comment on the matter.
