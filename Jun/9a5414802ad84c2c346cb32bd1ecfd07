KwaZulu-Natal MEC for transport Mxolisi Kaunda will tomorrow convene a special stakeholder’s meeting with the view to bring about lasting peace and stability in the ongoing taxi war in the Mbumbulu area.
There have been more than 80 reported killings in the Mbumbulu area and surrounding parts along the south coast of the province from January to April this year.
Last month, 58-year-old Bonginkosi Makhanya and his 16-year-old son Melusi were gunned down by unknown assailants on the R603 in Umbumbulu, while his four-year-old boy survived, on his way to drop his children at school. Makhanya was a taxi owner and chairperson of the Mbumbulu Taxi Association.
Kaunda said he wanted to engage Inkosi Khethukuthula Makhanya and other stakeholders with the main objective of bringing peaceful coexistence in the area.
