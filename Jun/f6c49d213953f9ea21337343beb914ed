The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has condemned the Malmesbury mosque knife attack in the Western Cape and conveyed condolences to the families of the two men who were killed in the attack.
Sanco spokesperson, Jabu Mahlangu condemned the deadly assault and urged intelligence as well as law enforcement agencies to redouble efforts to unmask those behind the recent attacks.
“We are convinced that these are well-orchestrated acts of terror and that those behind this heinous and cowardly acts that are defiling the sanctity of a place of worship are wicked people who have no place in our society,” said Mahlangu.
Three people including the suspect were killed in the early hours of this morning. 
Police said a man entered a local mosque during morning prayers and stabbed two worshippers to death. Several others were left injured.
Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said Malmesbury police were called out to a local mosque and found two people stabbed to death and several injured. 
“The suspect, believed to be in his thirties and armed with a knife was still on the scene and charged at the police who tried to persuade him to hand himself over. He ignored the calls and tried to attack police,” Traut said in a statement. 
“He was shot and killed in the process. His death will be investigated by [the Independent Police Investigative Directorate] Ipid.”
Western Cape community safety MEC Dan Plato also condemned “in the strongest possible terms the violent attack”.
“My sincere condolences go out to the family, friends and Islamic community of Malmesbury for their loss. I have been to the scene this morning, visited the families to convey my condolences and met with the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) leadership to whom I have offered my full support,” he said.
