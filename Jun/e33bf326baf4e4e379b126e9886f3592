An Engcobo man charged with the murder of a man who is believed to be his wife’s lover, was released on bail of R2 000 in the Engcobo Magistrate’s Court in the Eastern Cape today.
Siyabulela Fakade, 36, has been charged with murdering Abongile Tshengiwe, 32, and the attempted murder of his wife Thandiwe Fakade.
Fakade was arrested last week Monday, after he handed himself over at the Engcobo Police Station. He allegedly stabbed Tshengiwe to death after catching him in the company of his wife at their rented flat.
According to sources close to the investigation, Fakade had previously warned Tshengiwe to stay away from his wife after discovering WhatsApp text messages on his wife’s phone that the pair were having an affair.
The suspect who works and lives in Mthatha during week days, allegedly arrived at their flat unannounced on Sunday but his wife was not home.
He stayed alone through the night until his wife arrived the next morning accompanied by Tshengiwe.
When the two arrived he confronted them and used a knife to stab both of them. He allegedly killed Tshengiwe and his wife was rushed to hospital where she was still recovering.
In his plea statement read by his lawyer Bongani Mtati, Fakade said the incident was not planned and was unfortunate.
He claimed that he was not a violent man.
Fakade said he was the breadwinner in the family with two children who were in the care of their grandmother.
He indicated that he intended to plead not guilty to the charges against him.
The State did not oppose bail.
The case was postponed until July 26 for further investigation.
