An Orlando Pirates striker has been accused of raping a 15-year-old schoolgirl while her mother was in the house and his girlfriend slept in the same room, Sunday World has reported.
The alleged victim’s mother has accused the Police of protecting the perpetrator, saying that they have misled the NPA and that they have failed to arrest him or update her on the progress of the case.
The alleged incident took place in Centurion at the schoolgirl’s grandmother’s house after an event where alcohol was consumed, with the striker acting as mixologist. The player, who is dating the daughter of the alleged victim’s aunt, is accused of forcing himself on her while his girlfriend slept.
Gauteng police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini has confirmed that the police were investigating a case of statutory rape while failing to confirm or deny that the police are dragging their feet.
The star, who is yet to be named, has refused to comment on the allegations.
