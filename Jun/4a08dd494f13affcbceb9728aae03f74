Last year the hip hop star became the top tweeted celebrity in South Africa with his #FillUpFNBStadium campaign. The hashtag caught fire and when the big day came, Nyovest played to 68 000 fans at the FNB Stadium last November, making him the first local hip hop artist to ever accomplish such a feat.
It was just the latest step in Nyovest’s #FillUp journey, which began with packing out the TicketPro Dome in 2015 and the Orlando Stadium in 2016.
Not one to rest on his laurels, it seems Nyovest is having a second crack using the same strategy, when he announced the date for this years FillUpMosesMabhidaStadium on December 1st.
