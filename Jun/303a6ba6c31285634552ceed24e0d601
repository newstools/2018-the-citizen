During his address, Willemse said:, “It is with a heavy heart that I join you on this very solemn occasion. Today the entire Greater Knysna and the Garden Route grieves with every family of those who lost their lives through the horrific fires of 7 June.
“Though we can never erase their pain, or bring back those they lost, we can honour them by pledging our resolve to do whatever we must to keep our people safe from the scourge of bushfires,” the mayor said.
“Today we are here to unveil a commemoration statue. A statue that will remain to remind us all of what we endured and what we overcame. Memorials help to heal wounds inflicted upon people. And also to induce individuals to reflect on what they are capable in times of need,” Willemse said.
