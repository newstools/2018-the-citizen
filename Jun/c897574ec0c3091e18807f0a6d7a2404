A man was killed and his passenger was seriously injured when their car collided with a bus on the R304 in Joostenbergvlakte in Cape Town on Saturday morning, paramedics said.
ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene at about 9.30am, and found that there was nothing they could do to save the driver, a man believed to be in his 50s. He was declared dead on the scene, ER24 spokesperson Annine Siddall said.
“The passenger of the vehicle, a man believed to be in his 30s, had to be extricated from the car by fire and rescue personnel on scene. ER24 paramedics later treated him and transported him to a nearby hospital for further medical care. It is understood that not none of the passengers of the bus sustained any injuries in the collision,” Siddall said.
