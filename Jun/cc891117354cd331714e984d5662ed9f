The Mogale City Local Municipality on the West Rand is deeply concerned about the recent spate of killings taking place in Kagiso, Krugersdorp, particularly in Kagiso Extensions 9, 6, 12, and 14, and Azaadville and Azaadville Gardens, Krugersdorp News reports.
“The municipality urges the community of the entire West Rand to be on the lookout for a possible serial killer that is on the loose, and to exercise caution and avoid walking alone in both secluded and open areas,” Mogale City mayor Naga Patrick Lupidi said.

This comes after three bodies were discovered in the open veld, either by community members and/or police.
“The modus operandi in all three cases is similar, in that the deceased persons’ hands were bound behind their backs with a belt, and they were left lying on their stomachs. As a municipality we value human life, and the death of one community member is one too many.
“We are appealing to members of the community to assist the police with any information that can lead to the arrest of the perpetrator(s).”
