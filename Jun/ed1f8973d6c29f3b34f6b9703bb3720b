This past weekend was not a safe one for rich owners of sportscars as a Lamborghini Huracán‚ a McLaren 720S‚ a BMW M3 and even a Johannesburg metro police (JMPD) car were involved in a bizarre collision.
The two supercars are worth a combined R12 million or so.

The McLaren and Lamborghini were damaged on Sunday morning while being escorted by a JMPD BMW along Grayston Drive.
JMPD spokesman Wayne Minnaar said: “The JMPD were escorting sports cars from [the McLaren dealership in] Sandton to Melrose Arch for an exhibition.

The two supercars collided at the Grayston Bridge. Minnaar said police were investigating how it happened.













The JMPD vehicle was damaged in the process too.
“We are not sure if the BMW was part of the cars that were going for the exhibition.”

Although it’s enough to break a petrolhead’s heart, McLaren Sandton said the damage was “minor”.
Nobody was injured in the fender benders.
