They were charged with corruption and extortion, said police spokesperson Captain Augustinah Selepe.
The matter was postponed until Monday, when they would apply for bail.
“According to the complainant, the four suspects approached him on Tuesday and started to ask him questions,” said Selepe.
“He said they took him to the police station and threatened to arrest and extradite him.”
Selepe said the victim was searched and R10 000 was apparently taken from him.
“The complainant reported this to police. Following a swift investigation by Pretoria central detectives, the suspects were soon apprehended.”
Selepe said: “We will continue to arrest, act harshly against anyone found been involved in criminal activities, this will not be tolerated.”
She urged people to report crime committed by the police without fear.
“We thank the complainant for reporting this and placing his trust in law-abiding police officers.”
