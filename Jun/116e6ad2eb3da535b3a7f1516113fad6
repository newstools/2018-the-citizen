Muslim students have been banned from wearing scarves with school uniform at Jeppe Girls High, according to 702 and Lead SA’s Yusuf Abramjee, who has called on Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi to take action.
Lesufi has requested a probe into alleged religious discrimination at the school after being alerted to the situation by Abramjee.
In a letter sent by the school to a learner, posted in a tweet by Abramjee on Wednesday, a representative of the school’s governing body accuses the learner of not adhering to the dress code for Muslim learners.
Abramjee claims the dress code, whose rules include that head scarves may not be worn with the school uniform, is “unconstitutional and discriminatory”.
However, a former learner at Jeppe Girls High, herself a Muslim, says that she saw no evidence of discrimination while at the school.
She says that while she was there, learners were allowed to wear traditional Muslim dress as long as the school logo was displayed.
The ex-learner feels that the learner who received the letter was “maybe not abiding to the actual school rules regarding Muslim dress. From my experience those rules were not discriminatory”.
The school has been approached for comment, and has not yet responded.
