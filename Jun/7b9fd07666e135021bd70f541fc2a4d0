State prosecutor Louis van Niekerk on Monday told the Western Cape High Court that the postmortem results showed no signs that Susan Rohde hanged herself at the Spier Wine Estate in 2016.
Susan’s body was found hanging by her neck by an electrical cord from a hook behind the bathroom door of the room she shared with her husband Jason Rohde, who is on trial for strangling his wife and staging the suicide.
Van Niekerk said Rohde’s version of testimony was not true when he had claimed that the knot was tight around Susan’s neck.
He told the court that Desmond Daniels, the hotel’s handyman who was called by Jason Rohde to unlock the bathroom door, had testified that there was no struggle removing the noose from Susan’s neck.
“Daniels said that the knot was not tight, and he is the one who removed the knot from Susan’s neck, and you still tell this court that the knot was tight,” said Van Niekerk.
Rohde replied: “I cannot tell you what Mr Daniels saw, I can only tell you what I saw advocate.”
“I can put that to you, sir, that you staged this hanging scenario, you put her behind that door,” insisted Van Niekerk.
Van Niekerk said Rohde was not helping the state, as he said he could not recall how many knots there were in the noose that had been around his wife’s neck.
According to Daniels’ testimony, he saw a single strand that was loose around Susan’s neck, a statement Rodhe rejected, saying: “Mr Daniels might have been very shocked by the whole scenario and as I said to you before, I wouldn’t comment on what he saw.”
The matter continues.
