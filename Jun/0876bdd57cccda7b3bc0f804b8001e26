A public meeting tonight at Cape Town International Airport to discuss the renaming process descended into chaos and had to be scrapped. 
The assembled crowd was told earlier that no decision will be made tonight, as this is merely a process to collect public recommendations. The final decision on the name change lies with the minister of arts and culture Nathi Mthethwa.
The amount of money that will be spent on this name change is also undetermined at this stage, but the OR Tambo International Airport name change cost R5 million.
The first comment from the floor was that “Krotoa” or “Saartjie Baartman” are the only acceptable names and there “will be war if another name is chosen”.
Rapturous applause and chanting erupted as Winnie Madikizela Mandela’s name was recommended, but the next speaker insisted that KhoiSan heritage must take preference.
An argument then ensued and security had to be called in, after which the organisers lost control of the event and the meeting descended into chaos. It was called off amid singing and chaotic scenes.
