A Pretoria police captain who is facing charges of crimen injuria continues to serve at the same station where he allegedly racially attacked his colleagues. 
Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR) was appalled that Pretoria Central Police Station’s Captain Jaco Henrico seemed to be receiving special treatment, despite facing criminal charges of racism. 
Henrico briefly appeared before the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court yesterday, where his matter was postponed to June 19. 
For the past two years, the captain has allegedly been intimidating and degrading his colleagues, while calling them the k-word, LHR attorney Wayne Ncube said. 
But some officials allege their complaints would often lead to further victimisation. 
“There were complaints of crimen injuria and nothing has been done about it. He is still working for the police and has not been suspended. As far as my clients know, nothing is happening internally,” Ncube said. 
Henrico has been moved to a different department, Gauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said yesterday. 
“The necessary departmental steps were concluded and the criminal case was only opened after the departmental process had been concluded,” she said.
