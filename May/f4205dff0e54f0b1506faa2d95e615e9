Hundreds of JIC Mining employees marched to Optimum Mine’s head office on Thursday, demanding their salaries owed to them for more than a month now, the Middelburg Observer reports.
The affected miners received some more bad news when Optimum’s business rescue practitioners announced the suspension of JIC mining services at both Optimum and Koornfontein mines.
A total of 480 NUM members now face unemployment.

Their medical aids, pensions, live and disability cover were also suspended more than two weeks ago.
JIC Mining is one of the eight Gupta-affiliated companies under business rescue.
Business rescue practitioners, however, blame Gupta-linked JIC executives of using the courts to stall business rescue proceedings.
NUM on Thursday demanded that the Gupta executives be replaced by the business rescue practitioners.
