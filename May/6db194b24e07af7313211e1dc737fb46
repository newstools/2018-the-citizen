According to a witness, “doctors are not being allowed to work. All exits have been blocked. The situation is untenable”.
There have been additional reports that the gate is barricaded, the staff are rioting, the wards are locked and that people have been locked in the basement.
The M&G Bhekisisa Twitter account has said: “Staff at Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital have contacted Bhekisisa with reports that a man with a gun was seen inside. The Gauteng health department cannot confirm this and cautions it may have been a police officer.”
The account has also tweeted: “Department officials have characterised the situation at Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital as being ‘out of control’ and say police have been called to the scene”.
The source of the chaos appears to be a strike undertaken by the hospital’s workers. The reason for the strike is not yet known.
Attempts to reach the hospital have so far been unsuccessful.
We will be keeping an eye on the situation, and will continue to provide new information as we receive it.
