The Hawks have launched another probe into suspended Sars commissioner Tom Moyane, EWN reports.
Moyane was suspended by President Cyril Ramaphosa‚ who has accused him of gross misconduct over his handling of an investigation into former senior Sars official Jonas Makwakwa.
EWN reports the Hawks wish to finalise the criminal investigation into Moyane by the end of the month.
Though the Hawks spokesperson would not divulge to the news website the details of its probe – the docket of which was reportedly transferred from the Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit – he confirmed the investigation was separate from the disciplinary inquiry over Moyane’s handling of an investigation into Makwakwa.
Ramaphosa appointed advocate Azhar Bham SC to replace Judge Kate O’Regan as the presiding officer to oversee the disciplinary inquiry into Moyane after Moyane had claimed that because of O’Regan’s ties to NGO Corruption Watch, she would be biased against him.
