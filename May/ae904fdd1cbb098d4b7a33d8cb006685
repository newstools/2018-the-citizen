The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) walked out of a Nelson Mandela Bay council meeting today following a fallout with speaker Jonathan Lawack, who rejected a motion of intent aimed at ousting mayor Athol Trollip. 
While the African National Congress (ANC) followed suit, the Democratic Alliance (DA) and its coalition partners continued to push through a number of items on the agenda. 
When the EFF and ANC councillors were physically out of chambers, Lawack stated there was no longer a quorum and voting ceased. 
The EFF was unhappy because it had submitted a motion of intent on May 10 which aimed at removing Trollip. 
However, the motion of no confidence, among four other motions, was not cited on the agenda because paperwork had not met certain “requirements”. 
Other motions brought by the United Front and United Democratic Movement (UDM) sought to remove Lawack, chief whip Werner Senekal and to rescind a decision to dissolve the office of the deputy mayor. 
Notably absent from the council meeting was the UDM’s Mongameli Bobani.
