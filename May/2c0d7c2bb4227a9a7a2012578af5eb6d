Four people were killed and another was injured when a car was hit by a train at a level-crossing in Magaliesburg, Krugersdorp, on the West Rand on Saturday afternoon.
ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene at about 3:50pm, and found other emergency services already “helping the five patients”, ER24 spokesperson Annine Siddall said.
“There was unfortunately nothing paramedics could do to save the lives of three women, all believed to be in their late 50s, and they were declared dead on the scene. A man, believed to be in his 30s, was also declared dead by other emergency services en route to a nearby hospital.”
One more person sustained moderate injuries and he was transported to a nearby hospital for further medical care. The circumstances surrounding the accident were not yet known, Siddall said.
