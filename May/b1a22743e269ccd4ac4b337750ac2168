A partnership between the Japanese Embassy, the Cyril Ramaphosa Foundation (CRF) and the Kagiso Shanduka Trust (KST) has resulted in a development initiative worth more than R1 million. 
The partnership saw the construction of the Mpolokeng Primary School in the Free State, which has in turn led to the employment of 18 temporary workers at the school and benefitted seven small businesses in the community. 
“Japan’s economic partnership with African countries has been aimed at social upliftment and development initiatives,” said CRF spokesperson Tiffany Mac Sherry, who sang the praises of KST and its Integrated District Whole School Model. 
“This model addresses infrastructure development, curriculum support and social welfare, and leadership in schools at a district level,” she said. 
At a public private economic forum last week, KST and the Japanese Embassy showcased the benefits of partnerships aimed at enhancing economic growth, development and education. 
Highlighting the importance of education, CRF trustee and KST advisory board member Phuti Mahanyele praised the partnership. 
“We have witnessed what combined financial, strategic and technical efforts can do. The investment from the Embassy of Japan helped the Free State achieve the highest matric pass rate in the country,” said Mahanyele. 
Emphasising the importance of public and private collaborations, President Ramaphosa noted development challenges faced by Africa. 
“Africa is entering a new era of growth and development. To sustain this progress, Africa will need to deepen its relationships with countries like Japan,” said Ramaphosa.
