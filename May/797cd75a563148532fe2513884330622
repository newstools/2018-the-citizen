“There is potential for some areas to receive significant amounts of rainfall from this weather system,” said the weather service.
The eastern part of North West, the northern and eastern Free State, as well as Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), are provinces that will be affected by the thundershowers.
The risk for heavy rain will be seen on Tuesday in Limpopo and KZN.
