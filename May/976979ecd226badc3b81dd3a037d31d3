Capital city Tshwane is set to become the automotive capital of Africa with the development of Rosslyn Hub, a R50 billion Auto City project.
The project will be funded by the private sector and could become a blueprint for how to develop Africa’s future smart cities in a sustainable way.
Rosslyn Hub director Brendan Falkson said it was envisioned that Rosslyn, which is already home to four automotive plants – BMW, Nissan, Iveco and Tata – along with an array of automotive suppliers, will emulate established automotive cities in China, Germany, Japan and Spain.
This will create a second “central business district” northwest of Tshwane and on the doorstep of the Ga-Rankuwa and Soshanguve townships.
It will also be anchored by a labour-intensive automotive manufacturing core that will enable workers to walk to work and back.
Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga said economic prosperity was a key driving force in the development of the Tshwane region and his support for the automotive sector was part of his commitment to steering the city towards becoming the premier automotive manufacturing hub in Africa.
The Rosslyn Hub will include:

1 200 houses and 250 rental apartments;
A creche, primary and high school;
University with student housing;
Two shopping centres, a value centre and filling station;
A logistics park and vehicle distribution centre, with access to a world class rail logistics hub;
A truck staging area and truck stop;
Motor showrooms and a motor retail area;
A hospital and clinic; and
A hotel and conference centre.
