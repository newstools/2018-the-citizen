Thirteen employees were trapped underground today after a seismic incident at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Driefontein operations in Westonaria, Gauteng, the company said.
Head of investor relations James Wellsted said that the seismic event happened at around 1.30pm and caused a fall of ground in an operating stope at its Masakhane mine, Driefontein operations on the West Rand.
He said initially 13 employees were unaccounted for.
“Mine rescue teams were immediately mobilised and three employees have been located and have been interacting with the rescue teams. All efforts are being made to locate the 10 employees who remain unaccounted for, and safely recover all the affected employees,” Wellsted said.
“The department of mineral resources and all the unions have been informed and representatives are on site assisting with the rescue efforts.”
Wellsted said an update would be provided when more information was available.
