EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini on Monday urged “utmost restraint” after at least 37 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire during protests against the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem.
“Dozens of Palestinians, including children, have been killed and hundreds injured from Israeli fire today, during ongoing mass protests near the Gaza fence. We expect all to act with utmost restraint to avoid further loss of life,” Mogherini said in a statement.
“Israel must respect the right to peaceful protest and the principle of proportionality in the use of force. Hamas and those leading the demonstrations in Gaza must ensure that they remain strictly non-violent and must not exploit them for other means.”
Former Italian foreign minister Mogherini urged both sides to return to negotiations, saying that the European Union remained committed to its role in trying to foster peace in the region.
She warned that “any further escalation of an already extremely tense and complex situation would cause again further unspeakable sufferings to both peoples, and will make the perspective of peace and security even more remote.”
Mogherini’s statement comes amid EU divisions over how to react to US President Donald Trump’s decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
The Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania recently blocked an EU statement slamming the United States move, a spokesman for Czech President Milos Zeman said at the weekend.
