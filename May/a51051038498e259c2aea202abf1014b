The National Union of Mineworkers said on Thursday it was concerned that Pan African Resources’s Evander gold mine had decided to retrench 1 722 out of 1 812 employees ahead of going under care and maintenance.
NUM said workers had been served with termination notices on April 25 despite the union asking the department of mineral resources (DMR) to intervene.
It said Evander was constructing a R1.7-billion plant to refine tailings, saying the money could have been used to save jobs.
“If the company had used this budget to improve the ageing structure, as they allege, the closure of the mine could have been avoided,” the union said, arguing the mine had plenty of ore body that could have allowed the operation to run for another 40 years.
“The NUM position remains firm that if Pan African Resources can no longer be able to continue with Evander they rather surrender the mining licence to the government instead of closing down [and] dismissing  1 722 employees,” it said.
