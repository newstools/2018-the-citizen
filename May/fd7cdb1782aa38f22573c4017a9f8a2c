Former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille’s ousting by the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) leadership has sparked a new narrative on Twitter.
Reactions on the social media platform by users painted a picture of a bad horror movie where the “black characters die first”.




The announcement to expel De Lille was made on Tuesday morning by DA chair James Selfe and his deputy, Natasha Mazzone, on Tuesday.
De Lille, however, said she intended to make an announcement about her political future once she had cleared her name.
She said she would be legally challenging the termination of her membership because the cessation clause used to oust her was unconstitutionally and unfairly applied to her.


Twitter has been riddled with reactions of De Lille’s ‘booting’, yet one conversation that seems to be gaining momentum is the #DArejectsblack, which appears to highlight how its members of colour have been leaving the party, each one for different reasons.






Even the ANC’s election head and Twitter heavyweight Fikile Mbalula appears to think some members last in the DA while others don’t.




A question was also posed by users if the party had space for black leaders?
