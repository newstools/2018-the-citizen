Crime intelligence-led information has resulted in the arrest of two suspects and the recovery of several firearms stolen from a farm in Heuningspruit, near Kroonstad, Free State police said on Sunday.
Six suspects arrived at Mooivlakte farm in the Heuningspruit district at about 11.30am on Thursday, May 3, driving a grey Toyota Hilux bakkie with construction stickers and a yellow lamp on the roof, Colonel Thandi Mbambo said.
“The [48-year-old] complainant was at the farm with her employees where she was approached by heavily armed men and they tied them [up] with cable ties, then demanded keys to the safe,” Mbambo said.
The men stole seven rifles, R5 000 in cash, and three cellphones before fleeing the scene. Farmers and police were activated but the suspects were not found until Saturday morning, when the bakkie used in the crime was found abandoned near the graveyard in Kroonstad.
At about 3pm on Saturday afternoon, the suspects were traced to a house in Maokeng in Kroonstad where all the stolen firearms, ammunition, and cellphones were recovered. The bakkie was found to have been stolen in Bethlehem. The other suspects were still being sought, Mbambo said.
Free State police commissioner Lieutenant General Moeketsi Sempe applauded the police team that effected the arrests, and also thanked the farmers who responded during the activation and assisted in tracking and tracing the suspects.
The suspects would appear in the Kroonstad Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges of house robbery and possession of unlicensed firearms.
