An alleged robber has been shot dead and another arrested – both believed to be part of a group who has been terrorising and robbing students in Universitas in Bloemfontein, Free State police said on Sunday.
Students living in a commune in Stegmann Street, Universitas where at home at about 10pm on Friday night when they were suddenly pounced on by three armed men who ordered them to lie down on the floor, Colonel Thandi Mbambo said.
The men took two laptops from the kitchen, then went into the bedroom of another student and took two more laptops and a cellphone. As they were about to leave, they came across another student exiting his room and robbed him of two more laptops and a cellphone before fleeing the scene.
The provincial trio crimes (house and business robberies, and hijackings) task team and the tracking team, who were already following up on a number of house robberies involving students, followed up on intelligence-led information and went to a house in JB Mafora. Just after 11pm, the suspects were traced and found at the house where one of them lived.
“On arrival, one of the suspects pulled out a firearm and the police reacted by firing a shot which fatally wounded the suspect. One suspect, 31, was arrested and the third one, who is known, fled the scene. The suspected stolen property and a 9mm [pistol] were found and confiscated.”
The arrested suspect would appear in court soon on charges of house robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm. The team was still looking for the third suspect, Mbambo said.
Free State police commissioner Lieutenant General Moeketsi Sempe welcomed the arrest. “Any suspect who shall attempt to threaten the life of a police officer in the execution of his or her duty or a law abiding citizen, such act shall be met with an equivalent action within the ambit of the law,” he said.
