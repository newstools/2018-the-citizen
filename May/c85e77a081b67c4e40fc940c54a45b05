ANC elections head Fikile Mbalula was scheduled to become the latest politician to try his hand at anchoring the news tonight on eNCA’s As It Happens.
Mbalula tweeted he had been diagnosed with exhaustion.


This has led to speculation in The Citizen newsroom that the timing of his diagnosis is convenient, considering that General Bantu Holomisa became an international laughing stock for his inability to function properly as news anchor on the same show.
Holomisa’s fumbling of the saying, ‘You give a poor man a fish and you feed him for a day. You teach him to fish and you will feed him for a lifetime’, went viral, and was even posted online by rapper Snoop Dogg.





 Back to school night Comin soon

As It Happens currently has a different politician as guest host for each edition. Other guests have included the EFF’s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and Cape Town’s mayor Patricia De Lille, both of whom fared better than Holomisa.
