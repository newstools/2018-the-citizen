Even in a country like ours, which has some of the thickest-skinned spin-doctors on the planet, the statement by Free Market Foundation (FMF) executive director Leon Louw was breathtaking in its chutzpah and dismissal of medical reality. 
Smoking, according to Louw, has “health benefits”. He says smoking “contributes to decreasing depression and stress”. 
He gives no medical evidence to back up this claim and conveniently ignores the awful truth about cigarettes and other tobacco products: they are the only substances ingested by human beings which, if used as directed, will either kill you or seriously damage your health.
 Louw tried to make the case that Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi was infringing on the constitutional rights of smokers by announcing his intention to ban smoking in public places. 
Again, no word about the nonsmokers whose health is seriously impaired – and there is medical evidence of this – by passive smoking, or inhaling the smoke of those puffing nearby. 
The impacts of smoking cost SA billions of rands a year in increased health costs – treating heart disease, blood pressure and cancer directly related to tobacco – so any attempt to change, or contain, that reckless lifestyle must be welcome. We support the minister.
