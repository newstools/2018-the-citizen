Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced Wednesday morning that the country would hold its general elections on July 30, according to a document seen by the African News Agency (ANA).
These will be the first elections since former president Robert Mugabe was forced to step down last November by the military.
Mnangagwa will face a number of rivals including 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa from the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
At least 5.5 million Zimbabweans will be eligible to vote in the elections, which Mnangagwa has promised will be free and fair.
Should there be a run-off election, that would take place on Saturday, September 8.
