A 45-year-old state prosecutor appeared in the Uitenhage Magistrates’ Court for corruption, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (known as the Hawks) said on Wednesday.
Spokesperson Captain Anelisa Feni said Thozama Theophilus Takane appeared in court last week Thursday, after he was arrested on the same day by the Serious Corruption Investigation (SCI) unit of the Hawks.
“On April 23, 2018 members of the SCI received information that the prosecutor was demanding a bribe from 46-year-old man who was the accused in an assault case,” Feni said.
“Takane allegedly promised to withdraw the case provided he was paid the undisclosed amount of a bribe.”
Feni said the man reported the crime and through an undercover operation the SCI arrested Takane in court after he received the bribe.
