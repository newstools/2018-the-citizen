Tamaryn Green, a 23-year-old medical student from Paarl, Western Cape, was crowned Miss South Africa at Times Square in Pretoria on Sunday night.


This is the first year that the contest will have two “winners”, the primary one who will go on to compete at Miss World, and another crown holder to compete at Miss World.


Green will compete at Miss Universe, while Thulisa Keyi was crowned Miss World South Africa. Green, however, is the only recognised reigning Miss SA.
