Two local firefighters, Deon Esau and Jocelin Flank, have reached the final round of the Integrity Idol campaign, Roodepoort Record reports.
According to its website, “Integrity Idol is a global campaign run by citizens in search of honest government officials. It aims to generate debate around the idea of integrity and demonstrate the importance of honesty and personal responsibility. We hope to inspire a new generation to be more effective public servants. Integrity Idol began in Nepal in 2014, spread to Liberia in 2015 and has now evolved into a global campaign.”
