Humansdorp police arrested four men and seized 17 bags of dagga weighing about 500kg and worth about R500,000 between Stormsriver and Plettenberg Bay on Saturday afternoon, Eastern Cape police said.
Members of the Humansdorp stock theft and endangered species unit received information on Saturday afternoon of possible rhino poachers travelling in a white Nissan bakkie and a white Volkswagen Polo, police said in a statement.
They followed up on the information, and the Volkswagen Polo was spotted and stopped on the N2 near Stormsriver. The Nissan bakkie was spotted and stopped near a petrol station in Plettenberg Bay.
Police seized 17 bags of dagga and arrested four men for dealing in dagga. The two vehicles were impounded for further investigation. The four men, all aged in their 30s, would appear in court soon.
Humansdorp policing cluster commander Brigadier John Lebok commended the officers for their efforts and commitment, as the information required them to spend long hours on the road. “The information that came from residents was instrumental in the apprehension of the four men,” he said.
