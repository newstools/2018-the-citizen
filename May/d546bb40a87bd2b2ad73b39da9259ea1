The average daily water use in drought-stricken Cape Town has increased on a week-on-week basis to 519 million litres a day, the city council said today.
The council said it marked an increase of 14 million litres on last week’s average, which was a record low of 505 million litres, but was offset by a smaller decline in dam levels.
“Water inflow into the dams has largely balanced water usage. Dam levels have declined very slightly and remain at 20.9 percent.”
The city speculated that residents upped their water usage – which is not supposed to exceed 50 litres per person a day – because of warm, sunny weather.
“Water consumption often fluctuates from day to day and this rise could therefore also be considered a normal change in usage. We will continue to monitor water usage closely. It remains imperative that we all continue our saving efforts to get to the required target of 450 million litres per day,” said the office of the city’s’ deputy mayor, Ian Neilson, who is responsible for managing the water crisis.
Neilson cautioned that an uncertain winter lay ahead in weather terms and said conserving water remained critical as the region battles the worst water shortage in living memory.
‘It is important that our superhuman efforts to save water continue whether it is hot or cold. Outside weather conditions should have no bearing on our water usage. As a City, we are confident that our consumers will help us to stretch the available water in our dams as we move toward an uncertain winter period where we simply do not know how much rain we will receive and whether it will be sufficient to carry us through Summer 2019.”
