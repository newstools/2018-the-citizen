Police in Sunnyside, east of Pretoria CBD, have today launched an investigation after a 23-year-old man was allegedly pushed to his death from the seventh floor of a block of flats in the highly populated area.
“Police have launched a manhunt after a 23-year-old man was reportedly pushed from the seventh floor of a flat adjacent to the Tambotie block in Sunnyside yesterday [Monday]. The victim was certified dead at the scene,” said Sunnyside police spokesperson, Captain Daniel Mavimbela.
It is believed that the deceased, and a friend that had accompanied him, were lured to that flat through an online advert that had indicated that a luxury camera was for sale.
Reports suggest that upon arrival inside the flat, they were attacked by a group of men who allegedly robbed them of cash and cellphones. While the friend managed to escape, unfortunately, the victim was pushed through the window and he fell down to the ground.
No one has been arrested yet for the incident. Cases of murder and robbery are being investigated.
Mavimbela said the Sunnyside police are now on the hunt for a man who is known as “Ekene” who they believe could assist with the investigations.
“Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects should contact Sunnyside police station,” said Mavimbela.
