A new format was experimented with on news channel eNCA on Monday night that sees politicians hosting a show called As It Happens.
The first such guest host was the EFF’s spokesperson, Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi.
He spent much of the 8pm slot in a debate with Business Day columnist Peter Bruce after introducing himself and saying that he was an enemy of white capital in the “revolution” as an EFF MP and “communications commissar” and that he was using his platform on the supposedly white capital-owned news channel to present As It Happens.


Ndlozi challenged Bruce on why he had called the EFF a fascist organisation in a column, but Bruce denied that had ever been his view. He did, however, believe that the EFF was “authoritarian”, primarily because it intended to expropriate all land without compensation and then dictate what people would be allowed to do with the land.
He said that he failed to understand some of the coherency of the EFF’s policies.


He charged that the EFF would be changing the meaning of his title deed, though Ndlozi told him that government would only own the land, not his house or what he may have built on top of the land.
Bruce eventually urged the party to rethink its ideological framework as he felt it would lead to economic ruin in the country.


Ndlozi’s cameo as a news anchor was trending on Twitter on Monday night.
