The death toll after a seismic event at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Masakhane mine in Driefontein near Carletonville has now risen to seven after the body of another mineworker was reportedly discovered this morning.
Sibanye-Stillwater spokesperson James Wellsted said all 13 miners have now been accounted for, with six still being treated in hospital, EWN reported.
The man is understood to have succumbed to his injuries. He was among 13 mineworkers who were trapped on Thursday.
Rescue operations on Friday had to be temporarily halted at Masakhane mine after two seismic events.

Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe urged Sibanye-Stillwater to pay greater attention to the health and safety of mineworkers. The minister lamented that the gold sector had seen an increase in fatalities this year, with Sibanye-Stillwater as one of the main contributors.
Wellsted said there would be an investigation done by both the company and the department of mineral resources.
