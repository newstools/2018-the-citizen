The water supply at the Horison Tower has already run out, and soon the Florida North and Constantia Kloof Towers will lose supply.

At this stage, it seems most parts of Fleurhof have water, although at reduced pressure.
This will unfortunately mean the vast majority of ward 70 and its neighbouring wards will not have water.
For now, a publicly accessible tanker will be placed at Roodepoort Police Station and another at Florida Police Station.
It is expected the water towers will be filled during the course of the day.
Other affected areas are Witpoortjie and Tshepisong.
