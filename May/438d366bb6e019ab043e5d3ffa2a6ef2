Deputy President David Mabuza on Friday delivered the keynote address prior to the conferral of an honorary doctorate in social work on Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini at the University of Zululand.
The university said it had done this in recognition of the king’s outstanding role in the social welfare of rural communities and the fight against HIV/Aids.
Some have questioned, however, whether the honour might also be linked to the fact that the university is looking for title deeds to the land it’s built on, which is being administered by the The Ingonyama Trust, of which the king is the sole trustee.



The trust‚ which has administered about 3 million hectares of land in KwaZulu-Natal since 1994‚ is reportedly working with the local chief, Mandla Mkhwanazi‚ to transfer the land to the university.



UniZulu previously honoured the king with an honorary degree in agriculture.



Mabuza delivered the keynote address before the king addressed the audience after receiving his doctorate.
In his speech, Mabuza said: “This conferment does not only recognise the pioneering work you do, but is a historic endorsement of what goodness of leadership and human spirit achieves, if aligned with the sole purpose of bettering the lives of ordinary people.”
The Presidency also quoted Mabuza as saying: ““In honouring our King, we are also paying a special tribute to the generation of brave African warriors who fell in different battles defending our unity and land against those who sought to dehumanise us through oppression and marginalisation.”
