The Joburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) and the South African Police Service (SAPS) raided a house in Zondi 2, Soweto, yesterday and discovered drugs worth about R1 million. 
Police officers received a tip-off from an anonymous source and officers immediately rushed to the scene. Three suspects were arrested and will be charged for dealing with drugs. 
JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the drug laboratory was being operated in a back room.

“Our investigation team found the car which was linked to the house and found drugs worth R3 000. The suspects in the car then led us to the house and we found the rest of the drugs,” he said. 
A forensic unit was present during the raid and confirmed the drugs to be mandrax. 
Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubela said the owner of the house was an elderly lady and apparently unaware of what was happening.

“She pointed us to the back of the house and we found one of the suspects manufacturing the product,” he said. 
Makhubela said drugs were a problem in many communities. “It is sad to know that such drug laboratories are in our communities. We are thankful to our concerned community members for alerting the police. 
“This is an ongoing problem and we want to make sure that everyone involved in such operations is arrested,” said Makhubela. 
He urged community members to alert the police about such incidents and ensure that police conduct investigations accordingly. 
Police are investigating if the owner of the house was linked to the drug operation.
