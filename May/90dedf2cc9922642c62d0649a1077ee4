All initiation school activities in Gauteng this year have been suspended following a resolution taken by the Commission for the Promotion of the Right of Culture, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL Rights Commission). 
The initiation school season is normally between May and July. 
The City of Tshwane’s municipal health services said the move was aimed at addressing concerns around criminality, gross malpractices and unfavourable conditions that have crept into the traditional ritual. 
MMC for health Sakkie du Plooy said the issues included the mushrooming of unregistered initiation schools, violence, murders and assaults, abductions, extortions, illegal occupation of land, schools that have turned into a haven for criminals and noncompliance with municipal by-laws. 
“Although Tshwane was found to be fairly in order and having an effective initiation school bylaw, the commission has taken an all-inclusive decision to suspend all schools in Gauteng and to set regulations that prioritise safety and ensure compliance which must be met by December 2018,” said Du Plooy. 
“The city fully supports and commits to abide by the resolution as issued by the CRL Rights Commission.” 
The City of Tshwane will not process any applications this year, nor will it issue any certificates for the operation of initiation schools in 2018.
