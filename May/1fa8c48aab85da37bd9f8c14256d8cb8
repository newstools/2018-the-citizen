Trainer Justin Snaith has been having a great season in KwaZulu-Natal and if the bookmakers have got it right that good run should continue at Greyville on Saturday.
Snaith sends out Do It Again in the Daily News 2000 and Oh Susanna in the Woolavington 2000 and both have been priced up as favourites for their respective Grade 1 races over 2000m.
Oh Susanna won the Sun Met at Kenilworth in January and will be having her first run since that 27 January run.
She was due to contests the Guineas but was withdrawn dues to a minor injury.
This has not stopped bookmakers pricing her up at 7-20 to win the Woolavington 2000. She is very well handicapped and is between 5kg and 18kg better weighted with the balance of the opposition.
Do It Again caught the eye when winning the Grade 2 Daisy Guineas and should be even better over this distance. Bernard Fayd’Herbe takes the ride again and Do It Again has been priced up at 3-1.
That is because Stuart Pettigrew has also entered his top colt, Surcharge, who finished second in all three Triple Crown races in Joburg. Gunter Wrogemann rides Surcharge, who will be standing in for the injured Piere Strydom. Surcharge is on offer at 33-10.




There were no July entries of significance withdrawn at the declaration stage but Sean Tarry elected to run his Silvano filly, Chariot Of Gold, in the Woolavington 2000 and not the Daily News 2000 where she had also been a nominee.
Glen Kotzen-trained Philanthropist colt Pack Leader who impressed in both the Investec Cape Derby where he finished third and The Sledgehammer at Greyville has drawn No 10, while Trippi gelding White River from the Brett Crawford stable will make his bid from barrier No 7.
Oh Susanna is drawn No 9 in the Woolavington and will undoubtedly be the exotic bet banker for most punters.
However, Duncan Howells- trained Captain Al dilly Fiorella is not a runner to be ignored and with Muzi Yeni in the irons there will be some who believe she can beat Oh Susanna after having up-staged the Snaith stable companion, Snowdance, in the Daisy Fillies Guineas.


The Lonsdale Stirrup Cup has trimmed down to 12 runners with Dean Kannemeyer withdrawing four of his five nominees and leaving only the Silvano gelding Mr Winsome to fly the stable flag. Justin Snaith will campaign with three runners, including Dynasty gelding Made To Conquer who has won his last three starts.
Brett Crawford runs his Highland Night Cup winner Hero Quest while champion trainer Sean Tarry competes with Hyaku who finished second in that race and his four-year-old Dynasty colt, Shenanigans, who ran a good second over 2000m at the Vaal last time out.
