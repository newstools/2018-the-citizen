The 23-year-old was certified dead at the scene.
“It is believed that the man and a friend who had accompanied him were lured to the flat through an online advertisement indicating that a luxury camera was for sale,” said Sunnyside police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela.
He said reports suggested that upon arrival inside the flat, they were attacked by a group of men who allegedly robbed the pair of cash and cellphones.
“While the friend managed to escape, unfortunately, the victim was pushed through the window, and he fell down to the ground,” Mavimbela said.
He said no arrests had been made yet, and that police were investigating murder and robbery dockets.
“Sunnyside police are searching for a man known as Ekene. It is believed that he might be able to assist with the investigations.”
Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects may contact Sunnyside police at 012 422 3604. Information may also be shared anonymously at Crime Stop 08600 10111 or via Crime Line SMS 32211.
