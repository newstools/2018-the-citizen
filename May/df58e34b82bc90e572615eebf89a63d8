ANC councillor Andile Lungisa was granted bail pending an appeal on Friday after appearing in the Port Elizabeth Magistratesâ€™ Court.
Lungisa was arrested for smashing a glass jug over the head of Rano Kayser during a fight inside the Nelson Bay Council meeting in October 2016. He was granted R10 000 bail.
His defence lawyer Alwyn Griebenouw filed a petition for leave to appeal his conviction and sentencing to the court on Thursday.
Kayser was a mayoral committee member then and suffered lacerations to his head and neck. He was drenched in blood at the time.
Lungisa was sentenced to a two-year sentence for assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
Lungisa was found not to be a flight risk by the court, and is expected to report to the Kabega Park police station.
