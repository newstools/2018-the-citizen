Masuku feels he was attacked for no reason.
“As a steering committee we aim to prioritise the people of the specific ward where the sports facility is located and those are one of the issues we were supposed to address on the day. Unfortunately, the meeting was unsuccessful but I was lucky not to sustain any injuries,” he said.

The councillor emphasised that the residents consider policies and procedures that need to be followed for the project to be a success.
Another meeting is scheduled to take place this Sunday at the stadium.
