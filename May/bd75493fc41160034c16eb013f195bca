Convicted wife killer Christopher Panayiotou will have an application filed to appeal his conviction heard in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Wednesday.
Defence advocate Terry Price, filed the appeal against his client’s murder conviction last year.
The papers cite that the trial had been hugely biased in favour of the state and went on to suggest that Judge Dayalin Chetty had been biased in favour of the prosecution.
Panayiotou has been convicted of his schoolteacher wife Jayde’s April 2015 murder and is currently serving a life sentence at St Albans Prison.
In November last year, Chetty convicted Panayiotou for murdering his wife, along with co-accused Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko.
Nenembe was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and 15 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances.
