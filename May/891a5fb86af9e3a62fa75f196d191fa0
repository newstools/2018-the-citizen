Moeletsi Mbeki has labelled Julius Malema a “black racist”, and advised South Africa’s white population to ignore the “noise” around land expropriation without compensation.
Speaking at the Nampo Agricultural Trade Show, Mbeki said: “The ANC is using the land issue as a camouflage to attack the white population. It is supported and reinforced by the famous black racist, Mr Malema, who is very eloquent. He is actually now leading the ANC’s election campaign.”
Mbeki continued: “The ANC is totally mistaken. Black voters are very economically literate. They’re not interested in race issues. The reason they’re abandoning the ANC is precisely because its economic policies have failed.”
Moeletsi Mbeki is a political economist and the deputy chairperson of the South African Institute of International Affairs. He is also former president Thabo Mbeki’s younger brother.
