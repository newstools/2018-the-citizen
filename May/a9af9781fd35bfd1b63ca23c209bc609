The picket sees the DA attempt to voice their concerns over delays in the payment of Gauteng NGOs for the first quarter of 2018. “This is the second time that NGOs have suffered due to late payments, and is a repeat of the last year’s incident,” said an official DA statement.
The DA handed over a memorandum of grievances to MEC for social development Nandi Mayathula-Khoza. These grievances include timeous payments of NGOs, reduction of red tape in terms of registering for funding for NGOs and regular monitoring of NGOs to ensure compliance.
“Delays in payments of grant subsidies by the department have had a significant impact on the operations of NGOs as some have been forced to close doors like the Greater Benoni Child Welfare,” the statement continued.
“NGOs provide services to the most vulnerable people in our society and cannot be interrupted, as thousands depend on NGOs for food, shelter and assistance.”
