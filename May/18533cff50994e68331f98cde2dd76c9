It is alleged that the children ran away to call for her help when they saw him manhandling his ex. According to a witness who came to the scene, he was found undressing his former partner and when she asked that he leave her alone, he apparently produced a bush knife and threatened to kill her.
“That was when an alarm was raised and members of the community came in their numbers to assault him, throwing rocks to him. The mob also accused him of rape, and house robberies.
Captain Naniki Nonyana, spokesperson for Masoyi police, says the police found the suspect half-naked with head injuries and a broken left ankle. “An ambulance was called and he was taken to hospital. Unfortunately, he died on the way,” she said.
Nonyane warns the community against taking the law into their own hands, stating it was a criminal offence to do so. “We had opened a case of murder. No arrest had been made so far,” she said.
