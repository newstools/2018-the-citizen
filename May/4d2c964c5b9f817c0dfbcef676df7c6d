Estoniaâ€™s Taxify is set to step up its fight against global rival Uber [UBER.UL] across Europe and Africa after raising $175 million in funding from a group led by German automaker Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Reuters reported.
Daimler, already a majority owner or significant investor in a string of online taxi services across Europe and the Middle East, is adding Taxify to its investment portfolio, the two companies said in a statement on Wednesday.
