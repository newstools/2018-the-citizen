The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal has lauded reports that the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) is investigating eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede for allegations of corruption, money laundering, and fraud in the Durban metro.
“This is a sign that state institution can still be trusted by the public to ensure that crime is stamped out,” DA KwaZulu-Natal leader Zwakele Mncwango said on Sunday.
In March, the DA met the head of the Hawks in the province Maj-Gen Jabulani Zikhali. The meeting was to discuss and hand over a dossier detailing alleged instances of corruption in the city, he said.
“Today the DA is not only relieved by the fact that an investigation is under way, but that the integrity of state institutions like the Hawks is being reinstated. The Hawks must follow the money in order to clear out corruption. The arrest of corrupt politicians will minimise political killings in [the] province, as most killing are related to tender conflicts,” Mncwango said,
The DA urged members of the public to stand up and report corruption in their surrounds to ensure that action was taken. Institutions such as the South African Police Service (SAPS), the Hawks, and the public protector could not act solely on hearsay, and required citizens to lodge official complaints.
“The DA will continue to fight for justice for all and keep the government of the day in check. South Africans need a government that does not make service delivery a rhetoric, but implements it equally to all. The general public and civil society must take their rightful place in society and demand cleaner governments, the right way, as spelled out in our Constitution,” Mncwango said.
