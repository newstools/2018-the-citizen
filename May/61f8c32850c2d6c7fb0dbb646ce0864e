The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) will kick off a registration campaign that would see millions in unclaimed benefits paid to former mineworkers in the Northern Cape, the department of labour said on Thursday.

The campaign will target the Hartswater area in the Phokwane Local Municipality.

“The campaign is aimed at ex-mineworkers who left employment in the mines prior to 01 April 2002. This category of workers is urged to come and make applications for unclaimed benefits from the UIF,” the department said in a statement.

The long-awaited campaign came after a motion was tabled in the National Assembly in September 2007 for parliament to establish a committee that will attend to issues of former mineworkers.

“The campaign will continue on 26 and 28 June 2018 in Kimberley and it will spread to other towns across the province,” said the UIF.
