“The police crime prevention unit were on routine patrols around 7pm [on Friday] conducting stop and search [operations] when they spotted two suspicious men walking along Sisulu Street. Noticing the police, they fled on foot. A chase ensued and they were cornered and arrested at [the] corner [of] Sisulu and Pretorius streets,” spokesperson Constable Tumisang Moloto said.
“Police recovered two 9mm firearms and two pairs of hand gloves. The men are aged between 30 to 40 years. [The] Police investigation is continuing to establish whether these suspects are linked to other criminal activities in and around Pretoria.”
A case of possession of unlicensed firearms was opened at the Pretoria Central police station. The duo would appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Monday, Moloto said.
