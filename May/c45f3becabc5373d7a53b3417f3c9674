Trainer Justin Snaith seems set to field a big team in this year’s Vodacom Durban July, with his entries filling six of the top 11 spots on the latest log of hopefuls for the country’s most famous race.
A significant “new entry” among these is 2014 July winner Legislate, who, despite not having raced for two years, has been slotted into ninth spot on the basis of a recent positive barrier trial.
Impressive Greyville 1900 winner Elusive Silva comes in at number seven, while Daisy Fillies Guineas victor Fiorella is 15th after being supplemented into the race by KwaZulu-Natal trainer Duncan Howells.
Sun Met winner Oh Susanna and Premier’s Champions Challenge victor Coral Fever retain the top two positions with Summer Cup winner Liege in third.
