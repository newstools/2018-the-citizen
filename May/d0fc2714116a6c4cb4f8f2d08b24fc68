According to Brakpan SAPS spokesperson Captain Pearl van Staad, a convoy of taxi drivers arrived at the office of the Greater Brakpan Taxi Association at the corner of Wenden Avenue and High Street just before 9am.
Tsakane taxi drivers embarked on a strike yesterday.
“There was a meeting in Tsakane this morning, after which they travelled to Brakpan,” said Van Staad.
“The convoy was escorted by members of the SAPS Public Order Policing Unit.
“When they arrived at the office, shots rang out and the Brakpan SAPS were called for backup.”
Local police responded and seven suspects – who are believed to be part of a ‘VIP Protection Unit’ – were apprehended at the corner of Prince George Avenue and Voortrekker Road.
Van Staad told the Brakpan Herald that the suspects were heavily armed, and various weapons were confiscated.
They face numerous charges including murder and attempted murder.
Police are still on both scenes and motorists are advised to avoid the areas.
