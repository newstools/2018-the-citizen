Even the most die-hard Democratic Alliance (DA) supporter will, after the events within the organisation in the past few weeks, wonder whether the wheels are coming off the country’s only real liberal party. 
The spectacle of the ouster of Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille was, to put it mildly, unedifying. The waters were so muddied that it is difficult to tell whether De Lille is guilty or not of any corruption – and she maintains she is not – or whether she has been railroaded because the men in the party can’t deal with an uppity woman. 
That saga may well return to haunt the DA at the national elections next year because there are those who believe she represents the coloured vote – not only in the Western Cape, but elsewhere in the country. Others say she is not as influential as some may believe and that the DA will not be affected. 
Of as much concern, though, is the clear widening of rifts in the party along racial lines, accelerated by leader Mmusi Maimane’s comments on “white privilege” – a term which is antagonising conservative white DA supporters. The fact that Maimane has been congratulated for his remarks by President Cyril Ramaphosa will confirm for many of those whites that the DA they so loved no longer exists. 
Where will they go? Perhaps to Cope, whose leader, Mosiuoa Lekota, endeared himself to many whites with his recent comments against land expropriation without compensation. At the same time, many actual and potential DA supporters are trickling back to a rejuvenated and authentic ANC. 
We sincerely hope the DA does not shake itself apart. This is not because we are DA supporters, but because we believe it has been the country’s strongest opposition party – and a strong opposition makes a strong democracy.
