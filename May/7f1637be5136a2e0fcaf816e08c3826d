“We are here today to educate the public and create awareness why dolphins in captivity is wrong.”
“We want to emphasise the cruelty that dolphins caught from the wild and bred in captivity have to endure, and the conditions they are forced to exist in in aquariums. We hope to reach as many people as we can to encourage people not to support dolphin shows,” she said.
According to Ban Animal Trading SA, dolphins’ sensitive hearing make the applause, music and cheering at aquariums unbearable.
They explained that balancing a ball or jumping through a hoop does not teach people anything about a dolphin’s natural behaviour or conservation.
The group included concerned members of the animal loving community, members of organisation Anonymous for the Voiceless and people passionate about the cause.
