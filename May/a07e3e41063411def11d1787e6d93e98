The Western Cape High Court today convicted a gangster for murdering a police officer in 2016.
The court convicted Christopher Jantjies, a member of the Dixie Boys gang, of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition.
The judge found that Cape Town police metro officer Ben Koopman died of a single gunshot to his chest outside his home in Eerste River in the Kuils River area on February 15, 2016.
Koopman, driving a marked metro police van, and dressed in full police uniform, had popped home for lunch.
When he returned to his vehicle, with his 18-year-old son by his side, he was shot at. Jantjies then kicked him and said in Afrikaans: “I told you that I will get you”. He then fled with Koopman’s service pistol and two-way radio.
The son, Quelin Koopman, had to change schools, move out of the area and be placed in witness protection for his own safety.
Jantjies will be sentenced tomorrow.
