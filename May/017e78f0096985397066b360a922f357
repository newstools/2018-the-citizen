Masela said the couple’s 27-year-old son went out to open the gate and as he was opening the garage door, shots were fired.
“Two men came out of a Mercedes Benz and shot at the couple before fleeing the scene,” said Masela.
The victim was declared dead at the scene, while his wife is currently recovering in hospital.
“Although there hasn’t been any link to taxi violence established in the shooting, we would like to call on the taxi industry to resolve their differences in a peaceful manner. Fighting will never solve any dispute,” said Masela.
Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects. “We request anyone with information regarding the case to report it to the nearest police station.”
