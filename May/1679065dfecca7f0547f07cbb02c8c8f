Mobile phone company MTN said on Wednesday the United State’s decision to re-impose economic sanctions against Iran may limit the company’s ability repatriate cash, both dividends and loans, from MTN Irancell.
It said during 2018 the group had repatriated approximately €88 million from MTN Irancell, including €61 million relating to the full 2017 dividend due to MTN as well as a further €27 million of historic dividends.
The remaining balance due to MTN was approximately €200 million.
“MTN Group remains committed to our investment in Irancell and to repatriating the balance of legacy cash in Iran whilst remaining compliant with appropriate legislation,” the company said.
