Former Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s interim board chairperson Judge Tintswalo Makhubele has refuted lobby group Unite Behind Activist Zachie Achmat claims that she persuaded people to lie on behalf  of the parastatals board, according to reports.
Makhubele is responding to claims by the group who have pointed in her direction accusing her of convincing people to lie on the boards behalf. The allegations come after a Western High Court ruling on Friday.
The court ordered Prasa to hand over audio recordings of a meeting where a decision was taken to disband the Prasa boards legal panel.
Unite Behind activist Zachie Achmat claims Makhubele in her capacity as Prasa interim board chairperson convinced some “to lie on that boards’behalf.”
Makhubele however denies the allegations stating it was the first time she’s heard of them.
