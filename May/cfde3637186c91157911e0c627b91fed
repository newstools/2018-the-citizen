“Both suspects will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court (Tuesday, 8 May) on charges of public violence. A headphone and a cordless microphone was recovered from the 21-year-old scholar from Newlands West,” said Naicker.
“We welcome that fact that suspects are beginning to contact the investigating officers in order for them to have their day in court, and we are encouraging the outstanding suspects to do so immediately, before police officers pounce on them.”
The SAPS KZN Provincial Task team made a public appeal yesterday to help them identify 13 people, whom they believed could help in the investigation into the violence that occurred at the Moses Mabhida Stadium last month.
