Thirty-one people arrested in connection with violent protests in Koster and Derby in the North West are due to appear in the Koster Magistrate’s Court on Monday.
North West police spokesperson Sergeant Ofentse Mokgadi said they faced charges of public violence, arson, and malicious damage to property. They were arrested May 24 and 25 in Koster and Derby after violent community protests that began in Koster on May 23 and spread to neighbouring Derby.
All exit and entrance roads to Koster were barricaded with stones, burning tyres, and logs. Kgetlengrivier mayor Kim Medupe’s house, her guesthouse business, a town councillor’s house, and another building owned by the mayor were torched during the protests. Several cars were also burnt.
Mokgadi said six other people had appeared briefly in the Koster Magistrates’ Court on Friday. “Four of those suspects were remanded in custody until Friday, 1 June 2018 for a formal bail application. The other two suspects were released pending further investigation,” he said.
North West police commissioner Lt-Gen Baile Motswenyane condemned the public violence in the Kgetlengrivier municipality. She urged members of the community to refrain from destruction of property when they embarked on protests.
“We will not tolerate disorder and any criminality that accompany protests. While members of the community have a right to protest, that must be done peacefully as stipulated in the Constitution. The police will not hesitate to assert the authority of the state by arresting those who commit crime,” she said.
