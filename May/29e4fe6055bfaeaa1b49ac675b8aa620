A 23-year-old man will on Thursday appear in the Ermelo Magistrates’ Court for allegedly escaping immediately after appearing in the same court this week.
Police spokesperson Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said Thokozani Malinga made a dash for it on Tuesday. He was arrested by an off-duty officer on Wednesday.
“Malinga escaped at about 16:00 after he was remanded in custody. Whilst being escorted back to the holding cells, he fled from the court room. Malinga was initially arrested for business burglary which he committed in March this year, around Ermelo,” Sedibe said.
He will face an additional charge of escaping from lawful custody.
