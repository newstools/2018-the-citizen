This five-year-old Dynasty gelding is no star, as a record of three wins in 21 starts makes clear. 
However he has finished a close up second in his last two Gauteng appearances, and that kind of form usually translates to winning an ordinary KZN handicap. 
Young 4kg-claiming apprentice Luke Ferraris rides in this MR 80 1600m event for his legendary grandfather Ormond, and only a few weeks ago he teamed up with the family patriarch to ride the first two winners of his career at the Vaal.
In addition Shogun has seen the potentially tricky Pietermaritzburg course before, placing twice in three runs here while with Dennis Drier.
There is plenty to like about his chances, and while not a good thing, he should go very close to winning this contest. 
Indeed Ferraris and Ferraris could have another good day, as they also team up with Autumn Rain in Race 3 and Querari Viking in Race 5. Both have definite Eachway prospects.
Talking of value bets, one who appeals is Jeff Freedman’s Just One More in Race 6, a Fillies and Mares Handicap over 1950m. 
She has done well at this course with three places in four starts, and has seasoned professional Sherman Brown up. 
After making a solid return after a rest when beaten 2.5-lengths on the Greyville Polytrack recently, she now goes beyond 1600m for the first time. 
This Brave Tin Soldier filly has always appeared to be looking for this type of trip, and if that proves to be the case she will be heavily involved in the finish at what should be double figure odds.
