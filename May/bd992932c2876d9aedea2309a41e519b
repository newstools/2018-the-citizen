Moves are under way to identify a diverse range of talented graduates in order to have impact innovators that are also globally accredited.
“Nobody is a majority, that is the way we will teach the next generation,” said Peter Tufano, the dean of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford, who made his remarks at the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) roundtable annual meeting on Wednesday.
The GMAC roundtable is innovating the African education system through spotting a diverse range of talented graduates and offering them an opportunity to get into their desired school in order to further their studies. They also get opportunities to secure scholarships and possible recruitment.
The organisation also assists schools to enroll best suited candidates for business schools across the globe.
“We have a lot to learn from South Africa. In a world that is cold and hostile, we have a lot to learn about warmth and hospitality. In a world that is increasingly fragile, we have a lot to learn about resilience,” said Bill Boulding, the Dean and J.B. Fuqua Professor of Business Administration at The Fuqua School of Business, Duke University.
“African’s will have an opportunity to be discovered or to showcase their talents to schools, within the country across the borders,” said Sangeet Chowfla, the new president and CEO of GMAC.
