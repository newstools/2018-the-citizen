Black First Land First (BLF) leader Andile Mngxitama is on a mission to butt heads with Economic Freedom Fighters commander in chief Julius Malema in a debate on any topic.
This was prompted by Malema calling Mngxitama a “clown” following a failed debate between political parties about land expropriation without compensation hosted at Unisa on Monday.
The debate was attended by representatives from different political parties and academics but ended in scuffles.
Mngxitama, however, managed to deliver his speech without interruption.
Malema later took jabs at the BLF leader and said the EFF would not participate in any debate that involved “clowns” like Mngxitama because the EFF would be “legitimising” them.
“…without them mentioning us, no one listens or take them serous. We should create our own platforms and debate serious thinkers.”


This appears to have rubbed the BLF leader up the wrong way as he has since repeatedly asked the EFF commander in chief to debate him.
Twitter seems to relish the idea of a Malema vs Mgnxitama debate and Mngxitama seems to be using the platform to remind the EFF leader of his intentions.
In one of his recent posts Mngxitama asks the public for Zapiro’s contacts as he wants to commission him to do a cartoon on #JujuvsMngxitama. “We need this debate so that lies can be exposed. There is no running away from this.”
Mngxitama also challenged the EFF deputy president, Floyd Shivambu, to a public debate.
“They say I’m an intellectual clown, they have superior logic, now let them stop running away from a mere clown. Mini Hitler and his side kick must face Charlie Chaplin publicly,” tweeted Mngxitama.
He told Malema to stop running, as it was not like the EFF leader to run.
