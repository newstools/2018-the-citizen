A 34-year-old man was sentenced to two life sentences and 22 years imprisonment by the Klerksdorp Regional Court today, North West police said.
Lieutenant Colonel Amanda Funani said Goitsemang Johannes Phukuntsi was sentenced for three counts of rape and two counts of housebreaking that were committed between 2010 and 2013.
“It was reported that Phukuntsi raped a 14-year-old minor in November 2010 in Jouberton. In another incident, he raped a 23-year-old woman inside the toilet in March 2012. He forcefully took the victim to his father’s house in Khuma where he threatened her with a knife and repeatedly raped her,” Funani said.
“In the third incident in July 2013, Phukuntsi broke into a house of a 57-year-old woman in Jouberton. He then took the woman’s clothes before raping her in front of her children.”
He was arrested on March 7, 2016.
