Five men who were arrested in connection with the daring May 17 cash-in-transit heist in Gauteng appeared briefly on Monday in the Boksburg Magistrates’ Court, where their matter was postponed ahead of a bail application.
The case against Paul Sibanda, 28, Thato Gaopantwe, 26; Colin Hadebe, 42, Sibusiso Khumalo, 34, and Thabo Molefe, 32, was postponed to June 13.
The gang allegedly used explosives in the heist, bombing two cash-in-transit transport vehicles that were making their way to a bank from their depot in Kempton Park.
Videos of the crime scene went viral and a shootout ensued. Eight people, including security guards, were hurt.
During their arrest, police recovered an AK-47 weapon, an R4 rifle, a pistol, ammunition, detonators, explosives and an undisclosed amount of money.
The men are facing charges of armed robbery with aggravating circumstances, possession of illegal firearms, explosives and ammunition, malicious damage to property and attempted murder.
During their first appearance last week, lawyers representing the men told the court their clients were severely assaulted by police in an attempt to force them to confess or make statements.
