Rescue operations to find three miners trapped underground at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Masakhane mine in Driefontein near Carletonville on the West Rand are continuing.
Sibanye-Stillwater spokesperson James Wellsted said the rescue operation had been temporarily halted this afternoon after two seismic events.
Wellsted said the epicentre of the recent tremors is some three kilometres away from the site where the three miners are believed to be trapped.
A total of 13 people were initially trapped last night.
At least four mineworkers have been killed at the mine, and Wellsted confirmed that the deaths were linked to a seismic event at the mine yesterday.
Six people are being treated in hospital while three others are yet to be located.
Wellsted said there will be an investigation done by both the company and the department of mineral resources.
