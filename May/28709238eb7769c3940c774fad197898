Turffontein will host Joburg’s richest race day today with almost R11 million in stakes up for grabs. 
In addition, there will be more than R42 million to be won with TAB on the race meeting itself. 
There are three Grade 1 races on Champions Day with the R4-million Premier’s Champions Challenge topping the card. 
The Grade 1 SA Derby for three-year-olds carries prize money of R2 million with the Grade 1 Computaform Sprint, Grade 2 Wilgerbosdrift SA Oaks and the SA Nursery each with a purse of R1 million. 
From a betting point of view, there is R1 million being added to the Pick 6 pool with an expected total of R5.6 million. There are two BiPots and two Jackpots to bet on as well. 
In addition, there will be an intercontinental village featuring food, costumes and dancing from a variety of countries. 
There is also the possibility of witnessing history as Takingthepeace attempts to become just the third filly to win the Wilgerbosdrift Triple Tiara. 
The Mike de Kock-trained filly has already won the Gauteng Fillies Guineas and the SA Fillies Classic and victory in the SA Oaks will see this three-year-old filly pick up the R1 million bonus.
