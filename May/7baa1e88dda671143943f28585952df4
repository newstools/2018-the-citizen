A service delivery strike in Mohlakeng, Randfontein, on the West Rand turned into a looting opportunity after several local businesses got broken into and municipality buildings were torched on Wednesday afternoon.
A mini complex in Ntuli Street at the location that has stores such as Shoprite, Liquor City and Creativity clothing were looted, with residents running around with groceries, liquor and clothes.
However, it did not end there for the protesters, with the police failing to stop the angry picketers who were furious with the Rand West City mayor Mzi Khumalo for not meeting them last week Saturday.
The local post office, recreational centre, local library and clinic were also broken into later, with equipment and pills inside said to be stolen.
Later on the day, with the police nowhere to be seen, the angry masses went on to break the Absa express ATM and Shoprite U-Save store.
It is believed the strike is ongoing and the protesters wonâ€™t stop until they meet with mayor Khumalo, who they want out of the mayoral seat.
Some of the concerns residents say they are striking against high municipality rates that cause power cuts for some residents, unfair allocation of tenders, housing and lack of job opportunities caused by nepotism.
