The KwaZulu-Natal department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta) unveiled a mobile app today that will enhance municipalities’ ability to respond to service delivery issues.
The MEC for KZN Cogta Nomusa Dube-Ncube made the announcement about the mobile app during her tabling of the department’s 2018/2019 budget today.
She said the mobile app, which is powered by Vodacom, will enhance municipalities’ ability to respond to service delivery issues such as water leaks and potholes.
Dube-Ncube said the app would offer functionality to the public, not only to log service delivery incidents, but also to follow up on the progress in their resolution by municipalities.
“The app works from any cellphone and allows the user to take images of a matter to be addressed. A logged incident is allocated a reference number which is sent via a text message and in app to the citizen. For citizens without smartphones, the solution offers a USSD string which offers similar functionality to the mobile app. The USSD can be customised to local languages,” Dube-Ncube said.
In addition, the KZN Cogta also announced the rollout of Smart Exchange Innovation Hubs across the province.
The department says the hubs will promote small, medium and micro-sized enterprises in the information communication and technology sector and stimulate innovation that will create much-needed jobs.
It said it would be working closely with the board and CEO of the Smart Exchange to ensure that the benefits are felt all over the province.
