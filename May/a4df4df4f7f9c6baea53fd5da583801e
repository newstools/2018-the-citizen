The suspects were arrested on Monday night as well as early Tuesday morning.
The suspects held the security officers at gunpoint and used explosives to blast the safe open before fleeing the scene with an undisclosed amount of money. Two security officers sustained injuries, and were taken to hospital for medical attention.
The SAPS recovered two bullet-riddled cars, rifles, ammunition, cartridges, explosives and money bags in Seshego. The vehicles are believed to have been stolen in Gauteng.
According to police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, the heist took place in the early hours of this morning, May 28, along the Matlala Road in the Westenburg policing area, outside Polokwane.
“At about 05:35, a group of armed suspects driving in a white Isuzu double cab and a blue Toyota Rav4, attacked a security vehicle transporting money by firing shots at its wheels until it became stationary,” he said.
“The provincial commissioner has since put together a dedicated joint task team to hunt the armed suspects down. Anyone with information which can lead to their arrest may contact Captain Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501; the crime stop number 0860010111; the crime line sms 32211 or the nearest police station,” Ngoepe concluded.
Police say they expect to make more arrests connected to the heist this week.
