South Africa is set to review legislation which dictates the expiry date by which the State can pursue prosecution against perpertators of crime, specifically sexual offences, Justice Minister Michael Masutha said today.
“It has also become necessary to review the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 which, among other things, prescribes the period within which the State can prosecute persons for allegations of particular categories of crime,” Masutha said while delivering his budget vote speech in parliament.
“One of the categories in respect of which we intend to abolish the prescribed period of 20 years is sexual offences, femicide and all forms of gender-based violence. The review will also introduce harsher sentences for these offences.”
South Africa has a high prevalence of sexual offences against women and children, and there’s been a recent wave of women killed by their partners.
