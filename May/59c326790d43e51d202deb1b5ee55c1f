There is a strong push within the ANC North West provincial leadership to have a member aligned to former premier Supra Mahumapelo appointed as his successor, but the move is being strongly opposed.
The ANC national executive committee was expected to decide on Mahumapelo’s replacement over the weekend, but no name had yet been announced.
North West ANC sources yesterday said the party’s provincial executive committee (PEC) had asked President Cyril Ramaphosa to choose from PEC members, such as acting provincial secretary and speaker Susan Dantjie, finance MEC and current acting premier Wendy Nelson and Rev OJ Tselapedi, who is a former MEC of education.
These names excluded Mahumapelo’s ANC deputy, Sello Lehari, who conventionally should succeed Mahumapelo.
It had always been expected the ANC provincial chairperson would sideline Lehari, whom he saw as a threat to his power.
Also Lehari, who is currently MEC for education and sport, may have been excluded by the PEC because they did not trust him to protect their political careers, or to defend them against any future prosecution.
Political analyst Prof Andre Duvenhage said Mahumapelo and his former Free State counterpart, Ace Magashule, wanted to pass power to their loyalists so as to continue to remain in control.
