Empangeni SAPS has issued a stern warning to any jobseekers to stop entertaining con artists who sell nonexistent jobs, Zululand Observer reports.
This follows an incident where an Obanjeni man was swindled of his hard-earned cash by an unknown con man, who promised to get him a job at Qalakabusha Correctional Centre.
Mbangiseni Mkhwanazi, 20, who works as a cashier at Obanjeni Reserve, claimed to have made a deposit of R1 500, after receiving a call from a stranger who offered him a job.
“The suspect told me to bring my ID book, driver’s licence and wait for him at the gate after making a cash deposit.
“I waited for a long time at the gate and no one came, and he did not answer his phone. I then realised this was a scam.”
“From there I went straight to Empangeni SAPS to lay a charge of fraud but was surprised to get a call from the investigating officer to say he wants to arrest me, before investigating my case,” he said.
Mkhwanazi, fearing the arrest, begged the officer to withdraw his case and stop investigating it.
“I said this because I didn’t want to be arrested, although I thought it was right for me to report the matter to the police so that they can investigate and arrest the suspect, which will in turn stop him from robbing other job seekers,” he said.
King Cetshwayo Cluster police spokesman Captain Mbongeni Mdlalose said a case of fraud was under investigation at Empangeni SAPS, and no arrest has been made.
Mdlalose also refuted allegations that the investigating officer wanted to arrest Mkhwanazi, who is the victim.
