News channel eNCA is experimenting with a new format by inviting well-known politicians to anchor the news.
For the first time, instead of making and being the news, they will therefore be presenting it.
EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi will be the first politician in the hot seat on Monday at 8pm.
They’re calling the experiment #AsItHappens and are promising to have a range of politicians in charge of bringing people the news in their primetime 8pm slot.


Experienced news anchors Uveka Rangappa and Dan Moyane had a bit of advice for Ndlozi ahead of his gig.
They told him not to be bullied by his support team and to make it “your show”. They also joked about now being able to call him Doctor Ndlozi after he was recently awarded his PhD.
Moyane said now that he had his PhD it didn’t make him “bigger than anyone else. Just be yourself and authentic on air tonight.”
