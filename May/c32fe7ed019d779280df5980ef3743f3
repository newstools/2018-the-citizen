Unless the Gauteng human settlements department starts making significant inroads into the million plus housing backlog, illegal occupations will continue and conflict within communities will escalate, the Democratic Alliance said on Sunday.
During the DA’s oversight inspection to an unfinished RDP housing project in Kliptown, extension 11 in Soweto, Johannesburg this week, it was discovered that these houses had also been vandalised with the roofs, ceilings, windows, and door frames removed, DA Gauteng MPL Makashule Gana said.
The concerned residents claimed that those who had illegally invaded these houses were not the rightful beneficiaries and there had been ongoing altercations between these two groups, Gana said.
“Kliptown residents are understandably angry and frustrated, and are demanding that their cries for houses be heard. They claim that they have been on the housing waiting list for years with no communication from the Gauteng department of human settlements in this regard.
“Unless the department starts making significant inroads into the million plus housing backlog, illegal occupations will continue and conflict within communities will escalate,” Gana said.
Police were reportedly monitoring an area in Protea Glen, Soweto, where there had been more attempts to occupy empty land illegally on Sunday.
The land has apparently been set aside for a government housing project, but that has not been confirmed by authorities. The attempt to occupy the land has been continuing since Tuesday, eNCA reported.
