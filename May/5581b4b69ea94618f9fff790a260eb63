A 29-year-old man charged with raping two Nelson Mandela University (NMU) students appeared in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday, where the case against him was postponed for a pre-trial conference.
The man faces charges of rape, robbery and housebreaking.
In October last year, a 25-year-old student and her friend were violently attacked in a computer laboratory at the Second Avenue Campus. The man allegedly raped the students, robbed them of their cellphones and stabbed one of them with a pair of scissors.
The women were then forced to take a computer and monitor, which they had to carry until they were outside the building. The attacker ordered the women to pass the loot to him before he jumped the gate and fled, police said at the time.
It has emerged that the man has a previous conviction for robbery with aggravating circumstances.
The case was postponed until May 22 and the man remains in custody.
