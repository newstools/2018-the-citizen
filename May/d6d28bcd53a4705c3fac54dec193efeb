The African National Congress (ANC) in North West has welcomed the recommendation of the national working committee (NWC) that Premier Supra Mahumapelo should meet with ANC top officials, the party said on Thursday.

“We believe that it is fair that when someone is accused of so many things and tried in the court of public opinion, our movement – that has taught us the principle of being presumed innocent until proven otherwise – should exercise fairness and get all sides of the story,” said acting provincial secretary Sussana Dantjie.
“In meetings and in public platforms our provincial chairperson and premier had never been given an opportunity to speak for himself, and we are glad that he will finally be able to say his side of the story.”
A wave of violent protests erupted in the North West on April 18, calling for Mahumapelo to resign as premier. Shops were looted and property damaged during the anti-Mahumapelo protest.
The NWC, at its meeting in Cape Town on Wednesday, recommended that the national officials meet with Mahumapelo to discuss all available constructive options to resolve the ongoing impasse in the interest of the people of the North West province and the ANC broadly.
