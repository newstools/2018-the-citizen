Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, is one book which should not be judged by its cover. He may look like everyone’s favourite, kindly uncle, but the liberation struggle stalwart’s exterior appearance belies an inner steel. 
Now, he is in charge of one of the worst parts of the government edifice in South Africa – state-owned enterprises (SOEs). And he is clearly on a charge to root out corruption and to repair the years of damage done to SOEs through the malign financial predators involved in the state capture project. 
It is interesting that barely had the door to his new office shut behind him, there was a leak about a R1 million bursary paid for flight training for the son of North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo by arms firm Denel, a prominent SOE. 
That revelation was one of the reasons residents of North West capital Mahikeng took to the streets to urge the removal of Mahumapelo. 
In parliament this week, Gordhan sent out a clear message to those involved in state capture and those who benefited illegally from taxpayers’ money: there will be no place to hide. In addition, the minister made it clear he and his officials will be bulldog-like in their pursuance of stolen funds. 
Given Gordhan’s record of success as tax commissioner and later as minister of finance, we don’t think there could be a better person heading the posse bringing the crooks to justice. 
But Gordhan would not be embarking on this crusade unless he had the backing of President Cyril Ramaphosa. This, we believe, is another manifestation of the president’s commitment to root out corruption. 
However, it would be naive to think there was not a bit of political payback to the erstwhile staunch supporters of Jacob Zuma.
