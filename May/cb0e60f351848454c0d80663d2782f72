The Tshwane metro is yet to determine by how much the Mabopane, Winterveld and Ga-Rankuwa (Mawiga) residents will benefit from the debt amnesty scheme, Pretoria North Rekord reports.
The metro said under the scheme it would write off older utilities debt to encourage these residents to pay their current accounts.

There was “doubt about the real value outstanding on the bills” infrastructure and utility services MMC Darryl Moss told Pretoria North Rekord.
“There were many issues around both the quality of services delivered and the accuracy of the metering and billing systems.”
“If you settle your monthly/current water and sanitation account in full for the next six months, we will write off 50 percent of your old debt. If you continue to pay your monthly/current account in full for another six months we will then write off the remaining 50 percent, completely getting rid of the debt,” the metro earlier announced.
This amnesty only applied to Mawiga residents previously serviced by the Sandspruit Works Association.
The metro said those who wanted to benefit from this amnesty had to contact it to make the necessary arrangements.
