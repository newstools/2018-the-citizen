Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille today said the City of Cape Town was embarking on a series of discussions with communities around Cape Town to address the “spate of land invasions”.
“Tomorrow, I have a scheduled meeting with the residents of Vrygrond in my office to discuss possible proposals. We are waiting for the leadership forum to confirm their attendance,” De Lille said in a statement.
“I’m deeply disturbed by the spate of land invasions which at times has been accompanied by violence and destruction of property around Cape Town,” she said. “I also want to place it on record that the City of Cape Town will not tolerate land invasions in the city and law enforcement agencies will not hesitate to act against those who incite violence.”
She added that “land invasions are illegal and pose fire, health and flood risks to our communities”.
De Lille further added that she had also delegated deputy mayor Ian Neilson to hold discussions with representatives of Parkwood. Over the last few months, the city’s intervention has resulted in a lull in violence related to land invasions in Gugulethu and Philippi.
“We are continuing engagements with all communities and it is important for residents to ensure that land earmarked for development is protected from land invaders. We are not able to provide services such as water, electricity, roads and other infrastructure when land is invaded,” she said.
