A North West farmer’s son accused of murder and attempted murder is expected to stand trial in the High Court in Pretoria on Monday.
Matthew Benson, 24, was arrested in September 2017 in connection with the alleged murder of Tebogo Ndlovu 24. Ndlovu of Majakaneng, south of Brits, was allegedly killed by Benson on August 2, 2017, at a farm near Mooinooi.
The State alleges Benson fired shots at Ndlovu and his two friends when the trio went to the farm G11 in Mooinooi near Majakaneng intending to steal scrap metal. Benson allegedly spotted them, chased after them, and fired shots at them, hitting Ndlovu.
Ndlovu’s friends allegedly attempted to carry him while fleeing, but he was too heavy for them and they left him behind under a tree. He has not been seen since August 2. His friends escaped unharmed.
North West police offered an R100,000 reward for information that may lead to the successful tracing of Ndlovu, but nothing came up. Police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said neither Ndlovu nor his body had been found.
Benson was denied bail in the Brits Magistrate’s Court on September 29, 2017. He approached the High Court in Pretoria to appeal the Brits court decision, but this also failed. Residents of Majakaneng waged a violent mass protest after Ndlovu was reported missing. They blocked major roads between Rustenburg and Pretoria and five vehicles were torched during the protest.
