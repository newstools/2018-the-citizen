Sunday World reports the Gupta family’s IT company Sahara Computers alleges owes a Taiwanese IT company R15 million for non-payment for hardware.
The report says Fondiversal Technology filed a suit in the High Court in Johannesburg this week for not honouring payment agreements.
The deal goes back to 2015, according to court papers. Sahara allegedly failed to make payments 45 days after shipment, as they had been expected to, for three different invoices in June 2015.
It’s understood Sahara Computers’ Midrand headquarters have been deserted since March and the Guptas have been trying to sell the building for R50 million, or rent it out for about R400 000 a month.
The paper could not obtain comment from the company, or whatever’s left of it, or from the Gupta brothers, one of whom, Ajay, is a fugitive from South African justice.
