Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said school cleaners made the discovery at an unused toilet facility at Ntyatyambo Primary School in Sir George Grey Street, Zwide and alerted the South African Police Service.
He said at around noon, the Kwazakele crime prevention unit members discovered the fire arms and ammunition on their arrival at the school.
“Four firearms, which included two pistols and two shotguns, as well as 150 live rounds of ammunition of different calibres were found in various bags in the toilet facility which were used for storage of rubbish at the school,” Beetge said.
“The firearms will be analysed by forensic and ballistic experts to check if they were possibly used in previous crimes. One shotgun was identified as being stolen in June in 2017 in Worcester.”
Motherwell cluster commander Major-General Dawie Rabie applauded the swift response by the school staff and principal in alerting SAPS.
“These firearms are now off the streets and out of the hands of the criminals who placed them there. These firearms were possibly used in committing crimes, and suspected also to be used in future crimes.
“Our community can rest assured that their environment is now safer and police are expecting to make arrests soon,” Rabie said.
