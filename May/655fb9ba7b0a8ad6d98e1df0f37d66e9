The Inkatha Freedom Party MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa has urged police to accelerate investigations and ensure that criminals are caught ahead of next years general elections.
Hlengwa was reacting to the death of his friend and IFP councillor Sibuyiselo Dlamini who was fatally shot in what is reported to be a political killing on Friday night.
“The IFP is concerned if it is a political killing. We don’t want the election activity to be compromised by violence. We are calling on all political parties to ensure that we are working together with communities and police so these criminals can be caught. We are sick and tired of this violence, police must quicken their investigation,” he said.
He accuses police of not making progress in cases that involve killings of IFP councilors and members.
Hlengwa says the police service needed introspection to ensure that they had the necessary capacity.
Hlengwa was speaking on eNCA where he said police must speed up their investigations and solve killings in KwaZulu Natal.


Dlamini served as the IFP Youth Brigade chairperson in Zululand district before joining the Zululand district municipality as a councillor.
He also served as a member of the IFP national council, the party’s highest decision-making body in between conferences.
