Jockey Muzi Yeni has ridden a number of winners for trainer Joe Soma, especially a few Grade 1 champions. They team up again at the Vaal tomorrow in Race 6, and while this is a mere MR 89 Handicap, Tirzan could well provide them another winner.
The race is over 2000m on the Inside track which perfectly suits this four-year-old gelding as he has won three of his last four races all over 2000m on the Inside track. Yeni has ridden him to victory in all three.
In his last start this son of Seventh Rock touched off Miesque’s Rumba by 0.30 lengths and only received a 1kg penalty for the victory. As a result he comes into this race with just 53kg on his back. He is also well drawn at No 4 which should be ideal at this track.
However, this is a competitive event and there are a few runners with chances.
Sean Tarry saddles Shenanigans who undoubtedly has a big chance. He is the horse Lyle Hewitson rode to victory when he broke Gavin Lerena’s record for the number of winners ridden by an apprentice.




That was over 1700m at this track but he has won over the distance so that will not be a problem.
However, Shenanigans has been o for a short break and will also have to give 7kg to Soma’s runner.


If you like Shenanigans you also have to give Rocketman a chance, despite a weight turnaround.
Killua Castle might be heading towards his ninth birthday but Geo Woodruff is still getting plenty mileage out of the old boy.
His last win was last September but he is still earning place money and an eighth visit to the No 1 box is not out of realms of possibility.


Callan Murray last rode this well-travelled gelding on the Polytrack in Port Elizabeth in January 2017 but he gets the ride for the second time. They jump from barrier No 3 which should give them an added advantage.
