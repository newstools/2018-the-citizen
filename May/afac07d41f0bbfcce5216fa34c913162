Former Eastern Cape Premier Nosimo Balindlela has quit the Democratic Alliance (DA) and rejoined the African National Congress (ANC).
In a statement today, DA provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga said that he had noted Balindlela’s decision but believed that she was “misguided”.
Balindlela was said to have told the DA that she “feels the need to serve the ANC”.
“We respect that she feels the need to serve the ANC but believe that this is misguided as ANC corruption and maladministration have robbed the poor of billions.
“We thank her for her participation in the DA’s efforts to build an alternative government in the Eastern Cape and for her kind words of how she has enjoyed her time with us,” Bhanga said.
