President Cyril Ramaphosa has wished the South Africa’s Muslim community all the best during their holy month of Ramadan which commences this week and comes in the wake of a gruesome attack on a KwaZula-Natal mosque this weekend.
“The importance and benefits Cyril wishes Muslims well for holy week of this holy month of fasting, piety and charity extends beyond the lives of Muslims, as it contributes to the spiritual and social well being of all South Africans,” said Ramaphosa in a statement.
“This is a month that allows all of us to reflect on – and act on – the small, thoughtful things we can do to contribute to a better society.” Ramaphosa said his thoughts particularly go out to the Muslim community of Verulam, in KwaZulu-Natal, where one worshipper was killed and two seriously injured in an attack on Friday.
