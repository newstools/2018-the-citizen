A video shared to Twitter on Friday by anonymous user @AdvBarryRoux with the caption that, in his opinion, women in South Africa apparently get into fatal relationships with men is because “you don’t want relationships, you want money” immediately attracted attention in the wake of recent high-profile murders of women.
In the clip, the young woman explains that she’s sick and tired of dating men who disappear on her after a few months, leaving her with nothing.
So she explains that she plans to, in future, charge any man who wants to start dating her a R20 000 “joining fee”, with subsequent monthly payments of R15 000, “just as insurance”.
If the guy then fails in his payments, then she will withhold sex or even conversation.
She jokes that if he then later leaves, she’ll be able to pay for and enjoy her own “after-tears”.
“It’s not because I’m a gold-digger or anything like that,” but explained that she’d noticed that men are willing to spend R30 000 every weekend at Cubana, but appear to develop a hearing problem when you tell them about your student debt.
“So it just shows that these people … they have no good intentions.”

This is the reason why you get killed, you don't want relationships, you want money. pic.twitter.com/9ckFaxgLyw
