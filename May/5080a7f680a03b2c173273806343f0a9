A video that was allegedly recorded at a section of the Hartbeespoort dam showing a crocodile infestation has been wildly shared on social media, and as such has caused concern, Pretoria East Rekord reports.
The video was posted following reports that farm owners in the Hartbeespoort area were concerned over some of their livestock that had recently gone missing.

In a bid to find the cause of the missing cattle, an aerial video was taken from a helicopter. The video showed scores of crocodiles swimming around in the murky hyacinth-covered water.

Attempts to confirm the location of the where the video was shot proved fruitless.
Establishments such as lodges and farms around the area could not confirm the infestation or any sightings of a float of crocodiles.
Comments on the Facebook post by some Hartbeespoort residents said the environment did not resemble the area, while others said the video did resemble Hartbeespoort environment.
