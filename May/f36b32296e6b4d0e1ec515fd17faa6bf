Four suspects arrested for possession of suspected stolen food from Ramahlale Primary School in Mamelodi were granted bail of R2 000 each on Friday, Pretoria East Rekord reports.

Mbewe said the arrests were made by the police after officials from the department of education received a tip-off about a woman who was selling food to the public in Nellmapius extension 6.
“The first two suspects were arrested at their homes in Nellmapius, followed by the other two who were arrested in different places in Mamelodi East,” said Mbewe.
The police found vegetables, canned food, 5kg of samp and rice, 10kg of instant porridge and eight 1-litre milk cartons at one suspect’s home.
“Police went to several houses around Mamelodi East, where more foodstuffs was recovered,” said Mbewe.
Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he was disappointed that the alleged acts were committed by people the department had employed to look after school learners.
“The justice system must take tough action against the four suspects.”
Lesufi said he was emotionally devastated and would not tolerate this.
“The department would like to commend the police officers for their swift action in apprehending the suspects.”
The police pleaded with the public not to buy stolen goods as it was against the law and to report any suspicious-looking person or any person committing a crime to the police by calling 08600 10111.
