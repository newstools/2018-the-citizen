A 52-year-old man has been arrested after he hacked off one of his former son-in-law’s fingers using a panga at the Mugg and Bean restaurant in the Bedford Centre, in the east of Johannesburg, this afternoon.
Owner of the Mugg and Bean, Adam Filmalter told eNCA.com: “The two men were patrons at my restaurant and had been talking, an argument ensued between the two and we tried to contain the situation.
“It quickly got out of hand and we called for security, one of the men pulled out a panga, he aimed at him and missed a few times. 
“That’s when he pulled out a gun, luckily one of my customers threw a chair at the man in an attempt to disarm him. It could have been a completely different story if he hadn’t done that,” added Filmalter.
The suspect was arrested.
“A case of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm has been opened against a 52-year-old man, who attacked his former son-in-law with a machete knife at Bedford Centre this morning,” said Bedfordview police spokesperson Andre de Jager.
“According to the statement he gave, his former son-in-law had been intimidating his daughter, who had divorced him,” De Jager said.
The injured man was rushed to a hospital.
Police said investigations continue.
