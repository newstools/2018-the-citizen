The Black Sash wants former social development minister Bathabile Dlamini and former Sassa acting head Pearl Bengu to be held personally liable for legal costs involved in the extension of a contract for the cash payment of grants.
In papers filed with the Constitutional Court, the Black Sash says Dlamini and Bengu knew two months before approaching the court that Sassa was unable to handle the cash payment of grants, EWN reports.
The contract that was extended in March is now also in jeopardy, with Cash Paymaster Services telling the court last week that it is running out of cash reserves because it has not been paid.
The Black Sash says both Dlamini and Bengu acted unreasonably and negligently in their handling of this process.
The organisation says Bengu also provided conflicting information to the court, saying there was no contingency plan in place when parliament was told there was one.
The Black Sash’s Hoodah Fayker said: “They failed to let the court know timeously on the eve of this deadline in February. They indicated to the court that they needed an extension of Cash Paymaster Services for the cash payment of social grants.”
Bengu was a no-show at parliament last week to explain irregular expenditure under her tenure as Sassa’s acting head.
