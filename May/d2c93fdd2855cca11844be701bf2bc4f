Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga plans to beef up the Tshwane metro police’s anti-hijack unit, after he had his Mercedes Benz taken at gunpoint at the weekend. 
His ordeal made him “more resolute” to intensify the unit, to establish an “aggressive” team that works with police, Msimanga told The Citizen yesterday. 
“I am still shaken, but I am grateful to be alive. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. To be put in a position where you think your life will end in the next second – I don’t want anybody to ever go through this. 
“The city must have a much more strict and aggressive team. I don’t want to repeat what General Bheki Cele had once said but I feel our police men and women need to do a lot more,” Msimanga said. 
The mayor was held at gunpoint in the early hours of Saturday, when he walked to his car after having dinner with friends in Midrand. 
He said he was approached by men who were next to his car, with one pulling out a firearm. Msimanga handed over his keys to the thieves, who took off in his grey CLS 250. 
The car was found abandoned at a shopping centre in Ga-Rankuwa on Sunday. 
“When the car was recovered, it was already fitted with fake number plates … My laptop, iPad and some documents are gone. I hope the police get to the bottom of this,” Msimanga said.
