A 36-year-old man, arrested in connection with the murder of a 75-year-old woman in Gopane, briefly appeared in the Lehurutshe Magistrate’s Court today, North West police said.
Spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said Shuping Selebogo was remanded in custody until June 6, when he would bring a formal bail application.
He was arrested on May 29, in Gopane near Zeerust in connection with the murder of Keitumetse Nkgothoe.
Nkgothoe was killed allegedly by Selebogo, who was on parole at the time of the incident. He was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment in 2004 for house robbery.
The elderly woman was found with wound on the head inside her house on March 16.
“The old woman was taken to the clinic where she was certified dead. Consequent to that, members of the community took the law into their own hands and allegedly killed 25-year-old Lloyd Nkgothoe whom they accused of being responsible for the death of the old woman,”  said Mokgwabone.
Seven people were arrested for the alleged murder of Lloyd Nkgothoe. Members of the community embarked on a violent protest that led to the arrest of three suspects for public violence after the elderly woman was found murdered.
Community members allegedly forced Lloyd Nkgothoe to hang himself with a rope from a tree.
