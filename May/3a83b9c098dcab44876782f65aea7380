United Democratic Movement Bantu Holomisa’s blunder on new eNCA program AsItHappens appears to be causing another stir.
The UDM president wants royalties for a Huletts image that appears to be photoshopped.
A picture of a Huletts packet with the wording: “You give a poor man a fish and you feed him for a day  You teach him to  f… to fish, you give him… you give him… Ah No no no no…-Bantu Holomisa, appears to have caught the attention of Economic Freedom Fighter leader Julius Malema.”
Holomisa set Twitter alight a week ago when he became the biggest talking point in the country.
Holomisa during a television broadcast stumbled through the start of eNCA’s new show, AsItHappens, where he somehow failed to recount a proverb of teaching a man to fish.


The frustrated UDM president eventually started telling the teleprompter: “No, no, no!”
The UDM leader reportedly blames the teleprompter for the blunder.
It appears the joke is not over, as the Huletts picture also takes a jab at Holomisa.
The image caught the eye of EFF president Malema, who alerted UDM’s Holomisa to the tweet.


Malema, in his message to Holomisa, wrote: “My general, you see now,” accompanied by the the image of the Huletts quote.
Holomisa replied to the tweet, saying he needed to claim his royalties. It is, however, unclear if he was joking.
