The ANC in Gauteng on Sunday said it was ready to hold its provincial and five regional conferences before the end of June.
Briefing the media in Johannesburg, the party’s provincial secretary Hope Papo and acting chairperson David Makhura said the mood was “buoyant” ahead of the conferences.
“These conferences will be attended by a total of 471 branches that have passed the membership audit conducted by the national headquarters in March and April 2018.
“Branches will elect their selected delegates from regional and provincial conferences and nominate candidates for the regional and provincial leadership,” Papo said while reading a statement from the provincial executive committee.
The Gauteng ANC leadership said it has been inundated with reports from their regions and branches about large numbers of people who are demanding membership forms and cards since President Cyril Ramaphosa’s election as ANC leader in December.
The party believes that the conferences will restore the integrity of the ANC in the province ahead of next year’s crucial general election. The theme for the conferences has been named “100 Years of Nelson Mandela: The Year of Renewal, Unity and Jobs”.
Papo said there was “no turning to an era where ANC leaders became an embarrassment to the organisation, its supporters and the people of South Africa.”
“We care about restoring the integrity and support of the ANC in Gauteng. The successful conclusion of our conferences will put the ANC in a formidable and unassailable position to win 2019 elections decisively,” he added.
