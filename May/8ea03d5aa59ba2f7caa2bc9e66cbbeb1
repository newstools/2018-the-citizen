David Hodnett on Tuesday resigned as deputy chief executive of Barclays Africa and Absa Bank, and will also cease to be executive director, the group said.
Barclays Africa said Hodnett’s resignation was with immediate effect, but he would participate in a handover until the end of August.
“The board thanks David for his extensive contribution over 10 years with the group, including as chief risk officer and financial director, and most recently as head of the South Africa Banking portfolio, and wishes him well in his future endeavours,” the group said.
Last month, Hodnett’s future with the group was mired in doubt after Barclays Africa announced that he would take a two-month sabbatical without giving the reason why.
