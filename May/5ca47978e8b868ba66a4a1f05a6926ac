Former Western Cape police commissioner Arno Lamoer has been sentenced to an effective six years behind bars for corruption.
Businessman and co-accused Salim Dawjee received the same sentence in the Western Cape High Court on Thursday.
News24 reports that former brigadier Darius van der Ross received an effective two years in jail while former brigadier  Collin Govender received four.
It is further reported that Dawjee’s business entities were fined R60 000, of which R40 000 was suspended.
In February, the Western Cape High Court found Lamoer guilty of corruption, but not guilty of racketeering and money laundering.
Lamoer had pleaded guilty to one of the corruption charges he faced.
Lamoer, along with tow-truck company owner Dawjee, and former police brigadiers Van der Ross, Sharon Govender and her husband, Kolin Govender, faced 109 charges of corruption, racketeering and money laundering involving R1.6 million.
