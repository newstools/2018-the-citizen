More than a month after President Cyril Ramaphosa cut short his visit to the Commonwealth investor’s conference to address the leadership and political crisis in the North West province, the issue is still far from resolved and former premier Supra Mahumapelo is still in the picture. 
Democratic Alliance North West provincial leader Joe McGluwa said yesterday: “The ANC must tell us what is wrong with the current MEC, why they don’t choose from them. But we are not surprised they could not find a suitable person to replace Supra. We said before and we continue to say that the ANC is unable to lead this province.” 
Since Ramaphosa’s initiative to address the crisis, Mahumapelo, who stepped down as premier last week, has continued to exercise his influence as ANC boss in the province. 
The top brass at the weekend again failed to pick a successor. 
Yesterday, secretary-general Ace Magashule said: “We have not rejected any names given to us. We felt we should engage all stakeholders and our alliance partners on this issue. There is no time limit, this is work in progress.” 
The ANC was expected to choose a replacement from a list that included North West legislature speaker and acting ANC provincial secretary Susan Dantjie and former education MEC Reverend Johannes Tselapedi.
