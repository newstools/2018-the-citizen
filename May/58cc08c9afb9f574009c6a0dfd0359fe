A 24-year-old man has been arrested after he allegedly stabbed to death another 24-year-old man during a brawl in Ikageng, near Potchefstroom, North West police said on Sunday.
A quarrel allegedly broke out between the two, who were both allegedly under the influence of alcohol, Sergeant Kelebogile Moleko said.
“Consequently, the pair fought and the victim was assaulted with a wooden pick handle. It is further alleged that the suspect took out a knife from his pocket and stabbed the victim once in his chest.”
Paramedics were called and certified the man dead. The alleged assailant was expected to appear in the Potchefstroom Magistrate’s Court on Monday on a charge of murder, Moleko said.
