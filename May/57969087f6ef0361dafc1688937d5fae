A 24-year-old man drowned in the Midmar Dam near Pietermaritzburg on Saturday afternoon, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said.
Shortly after 3pm, paramedics from ER24 and the South African Police Service (SAPS) search and rescue unit arrived on the scene, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said.
“Bystanders on the scene explained to emergency workers that they swam out to retrieve a canoe when they noticed one of their friends were missing. Search and rescue divers found the body of the man in the dam.
“Sadly, there was nothing that paramedics could do for him, and he was declared dead on the scene,” Vermaak said.
