North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo will resign, he told the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) tonight.
“By tomorrow [Wednesday] midday, Supra Obakeng Ramoeletsi Mahumapelo, will be the former premier of the North West,” he told the public broadcaster.
He said all that was left was to follow the administrative process prescribed in the Constitution.
Mahumapelo told a sitting of the North West provincial legislature during his official budget vote that he would write a letter to the Speaker before Friday this week.
“In some critical instances of our lives we are called upon as part of humanity to create the essence of the absence of presence,” he earlier said.
“It is therefore in this context of creating the essence of the absence of presence, that in full compliance with the Constitution of the Republic [of South Africa], the Speaker will receive a commitment in writing before Friday this week.”
The African National Congress (ANC) in the North West said it welcomed Mahumapelo’s decision to voluntarily exit from his deployment as premier.
“As an organisation we will forever be appreciative and learn from his emphatic, principled but simple approach to issues. We also commend Cde [ Supra Obakeng Ramoeletsi Mahumapelo] SOR for having criss-crossed the entire province in pursuit of a better life for our people through the Setsokotsane campaign,” said acting provincial secretary Sussana Dantjie.
“We know that he will continue to serve his movement the ANC in whatever new role we will decide for him. We urge him to remain steadfast in what he believes are the necessary tasks of executing the revolution.”
