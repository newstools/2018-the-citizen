Cynics say principles never put food on a table. That is something for striking bus drivers to consider as their strike continues and as they earn no income. 
Spurred by the SA Transport & Allied Workers Union (Satawu), the drivers initially demanded an unrealistic 12.5% increase. We say it is unrealistic because it is almost three times higher than the official rate of inflation and totally out of kilter with increases currently being awarded in other sectors of the economy. 
Employers initially offered 8% and the latest proposal by arbitrators sees an increase of 8.75% from the employers, compared with the current 9% put forward by strikers. For the average driver, that difference between percentages means just R17 a month. 
In the meantime, drivers will have lost so much money they will not be able to recoup it, unless they work overtime. They will be worse off in a year’s time than had they accepted the first employer offer. 
This “scorched earth” form of wage negotiation is bad – not only because it increases anger on both sides, but because it results in workers gradually, but inexorably, becoming impoverished. 
No one wins in this zero-sum game except, perhaps, the union representatives, who have guaranteed salaries.
