A man was killed after he was hit by a train close to Alwyn Street in Gardenia Park in Bloemfontein on Saturday afternoon, paramedics said.
When ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene just before 4pm, they found a man lying next to the train tracks, ER24 spokeswoman Ineke van Huyssteen said.
“Upon further assessment they found that the man was in a critical condition. The man was transported to hospital under advanced life support interventions. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards he succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead in the hospital.
“The exact circumstances surrounding the incident were not known to our paramedics,” Van Huyssteen said.
