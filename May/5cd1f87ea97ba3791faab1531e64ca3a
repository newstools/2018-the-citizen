Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille made her 3pm deadline to provide answers on why she should not have to resign.
Addressing DA Federal Executive chairperson James Selfe, she said the allegations that have been made against her are “unnamed and unspecified” and that the successful motion of no confidence passed against her late last month had been rushed and not properly considered.
She took issue that the party’s so-called recall clause is now apparently being used against her retrospectively.
She also challenged the allegation that she had brought the DA into disrepute in the media.
De Lille then said that she felt many in the DA, including party leader Mmusi Maimane, were biased towards her and should be recused from any disciplinary action taken against her.
