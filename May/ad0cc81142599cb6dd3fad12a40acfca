Just a day after the N3 toll road was closed by protesters burning trucks in the Mooi River area in KwaZulu-Natal, a serious crash at the top of Van Reenen’s Pass closed the road again.
Three people died in the crash involving a minibus, three light motor vehicles, and one heavy motor vehicle.
Con Roux of the N3 Toll Concession told eNCA: “We had such a big effort to get the N3 reopened after what happened at the Mooi River area. We had traffic flowing well and smoothly throughout the day, peaking at traffic volumes of about 200 vehicles per hour. And then we had this unfortunate crash on top of Van Reenen’s Pass.
“There were indeed fatalities and it appears as though speed may have been involved. The backlog caused by this crash measures tens of kilometres and the road was closed for about two-and-a-half hours and has now just been reopened.
“We have a situation where the earlier crash on Van Reenen’s pass has been cleared and traffic is moving past that scene but we have the second scene down at Tugela Plaza so the north bound traffic is not yet able to travel through Tugela Plaza,” he said.
“All of the necessary emergency services are on scene working to clear the scene as soon as possible so that we can re-open the north bound direction of the Tugela Plaza.”
He warned road users to expect extensive delays in the area or they should use alternative routes if possible.
