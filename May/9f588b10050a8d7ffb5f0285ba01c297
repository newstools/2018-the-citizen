TRIGGER WARNING: This story contains sensitive subject matter. 
Ocean Basket’s latest ad campaign has been met with revulsion by some people on social media.
The campaign, which shows hands coming through holes in the wall to display plates of food from the popular seafood restaurant chain, has been singled out for its alleged similarity to the ‘glory hole’.
The question remains, is the association that people have been making between the hands in the Ocean Basket ad and ‘glory holes’ a natural one, or should people get their minds out of the gutter?
If you don’t know what a glory hole is, well done for being innocent and pure enough to shelter yourself from one of humanity’s less respectable inventions. If you would like to stay innocent, we must warn you not to read on.
According to Wikipedia, a “glory hole (also spelled gloryhole and glory-hole) is a hole in a wall, or other partition, often between public lavatory stalls or adult video arcade booths, for people to engage in sexual activity or observe the person in the next cubicle while one or both parties masturbate. In addition to the penis, fingers or the tongue may be inserted into the hole”.
Don’t say you weren’t warned.
Scroll down to see some of the reactions to the campaign.
