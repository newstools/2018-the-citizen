Bad news for those hoping the bond between two of South Africa’s best-loved celebs was unbreakable. TshisaLIVE has reported that Mzansi’s golden couple‚ Nomzamo Mbatha and Maps Maponyane, have split up following cheating rumours.
This comes a day after an interview with the couple, published here on The Citizen, where they detailed the secret to their happy relationship.
Sadly, the relationship seems to have not turned out to be the shining example of strength we hoped it was.
The couple‚ who have become firm favourites on the celebrity scene and who often referred to each other as “best buddies”‚ apparently called it quits after cheating rumours involving Maps emerged.
“The cheating rumours are nothing new, but Nomzamo got proof that couldn’t be disputed. She’s upset. She didn’t expect this‚” an insider told TshisaLIVE.
Those close to Nomzamo have told the entertainment website that the alleged cheating was even more hurtful because she had been through this before in a previous relationship with a well-known singer.
“They were good friends, and he betrayed that trust. She’s gone through this before, and he was the one who was there for her during that time.”
Team Maps has denied the cheating claims, and said his reputation spoke for itself.
