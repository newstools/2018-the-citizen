As expected, North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo has resigned from his position.
Mahumapelo told the media at the ANC’s headquarters in Johannesburg on Wednesday that he was “going on early retirement”. The premier went on extended leave last week instead of resigning as he had said he would.
Before announcing his resignation, the premier spent time going through the work he had done in the North West since being appointed premier. The province has been placed under administration by President Cyril Ramaphosa, with Cabinet invoking section 100 (1) (b) of the constitution.

ANC officials and the North West party leadership reportedly met on Monday, and according to the News24 report, a source who attended the meeting told the website the provincial working committee had questioned the party’s leadership as to why Mahumapelo had not been discussed with the provincial structure.
One of the discussions members of the ANC national executive committee, meeting at the weekend, are expected to hold is Mahumapelo’s future, the website further reports.
Mahumapelo’s expected resignation would come after province-wide protests and calls for him to step down. The North West premier went on extended leave last week instead of resigning as he had said he would.
