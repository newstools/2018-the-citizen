Dis-Chem said on Friday its headline earnings per share were up 6.6 percent in the year to February, compared with the previous year.
The company said turnover increased by 13.3 percent to R19.6 billion, as a result of maturing store base as well as the addition of 21 stores in the current year, resulting in 129 stores at February 2018.
“All core categories experienced strong volume growth as a result of maturing and increasing space,” Dis-Chem said. “As a result, the group continues to gain market share in the core categories.”
Dis-Chem declared a gross final cash dividend of 12.736 cents per share for the year.
It said it expected consumers to remain constrained despite improving sentiment, but that the resilient markets in which it operated would offer protection against the weak environment.
“The group remains focused on adding retail stores and scale to its base and leveraging off an invested cost base in both the retail and wholesale segments,” it added.
