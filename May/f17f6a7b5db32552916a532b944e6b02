The march was started in 2005 on the 50th anniversary of the Congress of the People, the adoption of the Freedom Charter and the 75th anniversary of the famous Salt March in India, organised by Mahatma Gandhi.
“We honour the memories of Mahatma Gandhi and Chief Albert Luthuli on this day,” said Gandhi’s granddaughter, Ela Gandhi.
