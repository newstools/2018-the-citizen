The three-year old video of a social experiment on child abduction is still relevant to South Africans, as some of us may wonder how it is that these abductions are prevalent enough to seem effortless for child snatchers.
The Alberton Record brought up the video again in light of Child Protection Week, which launched three days ago, Sunday, May 27, and will run until June 3. The theme for this week is: “Let us protect all children to move South Africa forward.”
Watch this eye-opening ‘social experiment’:

Even though the children in the video above have been taught not to talk to strangers, they willingly and without hesitation accompany the stranger to “see the puppies”.
Several mothers in the park were told of the experiment, and consented, only to be shocked to see their children lured away from the playground by a friendly stranger with a puppy.
Researchers remind parents that strangers do not necessarily appear scary or ominous. In fact, they’re most often friendly and charming.
