Following his brief stint as Cape Town’s acting mayor, social media has wasted no time in making fun of Ian Neilson wearing the mayoral chain.
The hashtag #BringBackTheChain was trending.
De Lille had her position guaranteed as mayor until at least the 25th of May, when part two of her legal challenge of her expulsion as a DA member will be reviewed.
The Western Cape High Court suspended her termination of membership on Tuesday and ensured that she is still the only recognised mayor.
Neilson, however, had already been hard at work picking his own mayoral committee and planning how he was going to run the drought-ravaged city.
He’s going to have to wait a little longer now.
Some even mercilessly compared Neilson’s stint as mayor to that other famous “weekend special”, Des van Rooyen.
