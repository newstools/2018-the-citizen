The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) today met with bus companies and put a new offer on the table to end a national bus driver strike.
This comes after bus drivers rejected the improved offer on Monday.
“We will not be disclosing the contents until we have reported back to our members,” said Satawu spokesperson Zanele Sabela.
She said all unions will hold a press conference tomorrow at 3pm at the Garden Court OR Tambo, Kempton Park.
The bargaining council and the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration (CCMA) had proposed an offer of 8.75 percent for the first year and 8.25 percent for the second year.
It has been almost a month since drivers downed tools countrywide. Initially, workers demanded a 12 percent wage hike and then dropped it down to nine percent.
Employers were previously holding firm on their offer of an eight percent increase in the first year and 8.5 percent in the second year.
The national bus strike started on April 18 following a deadlock in a three-month-long negotiation process.
