Basic education minister Angie Motshekga yesterday announced significant budget cuts for grants to build new schools and upgrade dilapidated facilities, saying the private sector may have to be roped in. 
Tabling her budget vote in parliament, Motshekga said the education infrastructure grant was cut by 1.3% to R9.9 billion, while the grant dealing with school infrastructure backlogs was cut by a “whopping” 43.5% to R1.5 billion. 
“The budget cuts, exacerbated by the fact that provincial education departments have since stopped to allocate funds for infrastructure delivery, will make it difficult to conform to the norms and standards for school infrastructure,” she said. 
“The current pressures on appropriate sanitation provisioning in schools will require innovative funding strategies, including generous contributions from the private sector and South Africans.” 
In March, a five-year-old pupil died after falling into a pit toilet at her school in the Eastern Cape. In 2014, a five-year-old boy also drowned in faeces after falling into a pit latrine in Limpopo.
