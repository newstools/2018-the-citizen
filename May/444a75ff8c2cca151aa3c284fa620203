The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation Unit (DPCI), better known as the Hawks, have spoken out after reports painted a picture of a tragic bungle when a Pretoria man was killed on Thursday.
TimesLIVE reported that police killed a Pretoria homeowner and critically injured his family after they stormed the wrong house.
Hawks spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu issued a statement telling a different outcome from the one reported by TimesLIVE. In the statement, the Hawks say the operation led to positive results, with four people arrested in Queenswood, east of Pretoria.
The Hawks, together with the crime intelligence unit, followed up on information of a possible ploy to execute a cash-in-transit (CIT) heist in Pretoria.
According to the Hawks, there was information that a group of suspects were planning the CIT heist.
“With the assistance of the SAPS Task Force members, the team went to the house, and as they approached, they saw a vehicle parked at the vicinity with three suspects inside.”
The vehicle was stolen, according to the Hawks. The suspects sped off, and a chase ensued as the police were about to execute an arrest.
“The suspects in their attempt to escape rammed into a civilian vehicle. Two of the suspects were shot whilst the other was arrested attempting to escape on foot. A fourth suspect was arrested at the house.”
The Hawks say the TimesLIVE report was a blatant misrepresentation of the facts and must be condemned.
“No person was killed, the suspects were driving a stolen vehicle, and the house that was targeted was positive.”
The Hawks say two of the suspects are in hospital under police guard, while the other two are in hospital, also under police guard.
The suspects aged between 24 and 29 are expected to appear at the Pretoria Magistrates’ Court on Monday facing charges of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and possession of a stolen vehicle.
