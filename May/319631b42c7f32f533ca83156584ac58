The Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) said it had issued a notice to the Mossel Bay Yacht Club to vacate its port premises by the end of May 2018 in line with a high court order.
The club had unsuccessfully asked the court to overturn a decision by the ports authority to award a lease tender for the premises currently occupied by the yacht club to Mossel Bay Waterfront.
“We are confident that this decision will enable the port and the new lessee – through its strong business model – to provide all members of society with an equal opportunity to participate in port activities,” Port of Mossel Bay port manager Shadrack Tshikalange said.
“This is in line with TNPA’s smart people’s ports vision, which includes promoting greater public access and ensuring a vibrant port system that connects local communities to port activities.”
The high court found that points awarded in the tender process to Mossel Bay Waterfront were justified for new skills development, job creation and/or preservation, small business promotion and rural/community development and regional integration.
TNPA is one of five operating divisions of state-owned logistics company Transnet, and is responsible for the safe, effective and efficient economic functioning of the national port system, which it manages in a landlord capacity.
It provides port infrastructure and marine services at the eight commercial seaports in the country, namely Richards Bay, Durban, Saldanha, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London, Mossel Bay and Ngqura.
