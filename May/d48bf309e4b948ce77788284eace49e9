“I want to applaud the dedication and excellent detective work carried out by our law enforcement officers in this case. This will go a long way to send a strong message that women’s rights and those of girl children are human rights,” Nkosi-Malobane said.
“I also want to commend my team at Ikhaya Lethemba for providing court preparation support, trauma counselling services, accommodation and sexual offences seminars to the victims of this heinous crimes. This provided the much-needed psychological support and positive re-integration into the society.”
Between 2012 and 2014, Chauke raped 23 women in the Tembisa, Ivory Park and Kempton areas. His modus operandi was to break into the victims’ houses and rape them. He also accosted and attacked their partners and made them watch whilst he raped them. He was arrested in 2015.
Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said Chauke was spotted by a rape victim three months after the incident in December 2015.
Masondo said that police swiftly responded to the woman’s call and arrested the suspect who was subsequently subjected to forensic tests as part of the thorough investigation, successfully linking him to a total of 17 other cases that had previously been reported to the police.
