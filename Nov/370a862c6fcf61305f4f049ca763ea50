A football team in Brazil was saved from conceding a goal after a heroic sausage dog came to the rescue, The Mirror reports.
The timing of the daring dachshund, whose actions managed what the team’s goalkeeper could not, after he dived the wrong way following a spot kick, must be seen to be believed.
The goalkeeper can be seen celebrating afterwards, despite the fact that due to the superior skills showed by the dog, his place in the starting line-up may not be that secure.
