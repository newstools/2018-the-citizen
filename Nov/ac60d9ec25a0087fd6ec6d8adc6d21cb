According to Dohan Bezuidenhout of Hi-Tech Northern Regions, who was on the scene, the incident happened at around 10pm as Ruthven arrived home.
“The suspects tampered with his gate, not allowing it to open,” he said. Ruthven remained in his vehicle, but was shot through the window of his bakkie.

Andries Ruthven’s vehicle was riddled with bullets.
He was rushed to MediClinic Nelspruit. According to his father Thys, the fact that he survived was a miracle.
“The bullet missed all vital organs, and he is now in a stable condition,” he said.
Though in a lot of pain, as the bullet hit and broke his ribs, he is fully conscious and recovering well.
No arrests have yet been made.
