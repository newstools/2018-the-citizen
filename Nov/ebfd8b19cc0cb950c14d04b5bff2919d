Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba, and MMC for Housing, Meshack Van Wyk, will tomorrow launch 525 social housing units in Turffontein.
In a statement Mashaba said he was pleased with the work being done by the city’s social housing entity, JOSHCO (Johannesburg Social Housing Company), which is responsible for the R191-million development.
“Each block has an inner courtyard with a play area for children. There is also ample space for parking in the precinct and a biometric access control system with technological advanced neighbourhoods that have access to recreational facilities and amenities.”
“This cosmopolitan project consists of one-bedroom and two-bedroom communal rental units targeting people earning between R1 500 and R15 000 a month,” said Mashaba.
