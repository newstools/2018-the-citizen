There are some short-priced runners in feature races on the Charity Mile card at Turffontein on Saturday.
But, outside of these favoured few – who might well fail to fire – plenty of value is available to punters.
Noble Secret is 3-1 to win the main race, while Coral Fever, 2018 Highveld Horse of the Year no less, languishes at 12-1 and 10-time winner Captain Aldo at 14-1.
Bookmakers cannot separate Chimichuri Run and Alyaasaat – saddled by top trainers Sean Tarry and Mike de Kock – in the Graham Beck Stakes.
The colts are joint favourites at 18-10, with 8-1 chance National Park the only other runner anywhere near.
It is a three-year-old contest with improving young horses, so the likes of Green Haze, Rule The Night and Firdoas could easily up-set expectations at long odds.
Similarly, three horses domi-nate be ing for the Princess Charlene Starling Stakes: Celtic Sea (28-10), Ghaalla and Isle De France (both 7-2).
Twelve other relatively unexposed fi llies are available from 10-1 and upwards.
