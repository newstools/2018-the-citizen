A flasher has been terrorising young school girls in the green strip behind Highveld Ridge Primary School for months reports Ridge Times.
According the principal, Mr Marinus Strydom, the man exposes his genitals to little girls after school and then runs off the minute a teacher is alerted.
“We have received several complaints over time. We have called in the police to help catch the man.”
The flasher was back on Tuesday, 24 October.
According to Mr Strydom, the culprit now waits for his victims before school.
“Some of our children are here very early and the man has been spotted in the green strip behind the playground at about 6.30am.
“We call on the community to assist us in catching this fiend.”
Mr Strydom said another major concern for the school is the people who drink and use drugs in the field right next to the school and close to the Senecta Shopping Centre.
“Our learners have to pass there when going to and from school, and we feel that area is really unsafe and unsavoury.”
Anyone with information that can help the police catch the flasher are asked to contact the Secunda Police Station at 017 624 2000.
