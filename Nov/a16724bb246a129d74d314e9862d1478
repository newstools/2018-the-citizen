In an intelligence-led operation, a 49-year-old man was arrested on drug-related charges in Port Elizabeth by South African Police Service (SAPS) national intervention unit officers on Saturday, Eastern Cape police said.
The officers swooped on at a house in Ralton Street in Sidwell, Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said on Sunday.
“Upon searching the place, police seized seven large plastic bags (6.468 kg) of dagga; 175 (5.78g) rolls of dagga; 62 Mandrax tablets; 17 half boss Mandrax tablets; and R5 285 in cash.”
The estimated value of the drugs was R10 000. The arrested man would appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court on Monday on a charge of dealing in drugs, Labans said.
