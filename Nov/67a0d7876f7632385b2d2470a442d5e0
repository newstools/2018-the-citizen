All six suspects were due to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday, facing charges of fraud, theft, and pitch invasion.
On Saturday, the first four suspects, aged between 27 and 32, were arrested.
“Two of them were caught selling fake tickets. One suspect was arrested for pitch invasion, while the last suspect was arrested for stealing alcohol from a bar at the stadium. Yesterday, a further two suspects were arrested for selling fake tickets at the stadium.”
Police are appealing to the community not to purchase fake tickets from unauthorised persons as it could lead to overcrowding at stadiums.
“Police will be on high alert and ensure a zero-tolerance approach in dealing with criminal elements at our sports stadiums,” she concluded.
