Though small fields abound in all but one of the eight events at the Fairview Polytrack today, it will not be easy pickings for punters as they are faced with a highly competitive card.
However, champion trainer Alan Greeff has thrown them a lifeline with Searching (Greg Cheyne) who contests Race 4, a FM 83 Handicap over 2000m.
This two-time winning daughter of Jay Peg was unplaced only once in her nine starts and that was on debut.
Cheyne has a fine association with this filly in five rides – winning twice, with two seconds and a third. Both wins were at the Polytrack over 1600m, the last of which was in her penultimate outing when she came off a three-month layoff and scored gamely in a Novice Plate.
The four-year-old was not dis-graced in her subsequent outing when carrying 57kg and sent off favourite again, as she ran on stoutly from last a er a slow start to finish just a neck second in a 1600m MR 78 Handicap. She will be tough to beat this time with a handy galloping weight of 55.5kg and stepping up the distance as well.
Expect a brave bid from Sharon Kotzen-trained five-time winner Chit Chat who carries 60kg top-weight with Louis Mxothwa aboard.
This mare has been threatening a win with Mxothwa up, more so, in her penultimate outing when carrying 55kg and finishing second in a 2200m Pinnacle Stakes at the Polytrack.
Her subsequent run when carrying 58kg and unplaced is best overlooked as Mxothwa had again tried front-running tactics.
