Trainer Candice Dawson’s yard is in exquisite form, and she could make the headlines once more when her classy five-year-old mare Sylvan On Fire competes in the Yellowwood Handicap (Grade 3) over 1800m at Turffontein tomorrow.
She ran her socks off in her latest performance when producing a devastating turn of foot in the dying stages, impressively making up a mammoth 11.80 lengths over the final 350m, beaten by a rapidly diminishing 2.60 lengths by Cascapedia in a Grade 2 race.
She was in desperate need of a run on that occasion and can be forgiven for that sixth-place finish considering she was returning from a lengthy seven-month stint off the racetrack.
And spread a shoe in running – nothing went her way.She has a lot in her favour.
The only chink in her armour is the shockingly wide No 13 draw she jumps from in this 14-horse field – good thing she has the in-form, former champion jockey Gavin Lerena aboard!
Sylvan On Fire was on a four-run winning streak late last year, so is clearly no slouch.
She is no stranger to this trip having competed twice over it for a gutsy triumph and an uninspiring eighth, which is best ignored, because she was reported as being fatigued.
“Sylvan On Fire is doing well at home and I just hope Gavin (Lere-na) can get her over from No 13 draw,” said Dawson to Phumelela Publishing.
“She should be running at them at the finish. I think both my fillies (Royal Utopia) are well handicapped.”
If brings her “A” game to the racecourse on Saturday after-noon, she will be very hard to outrun.
That last performance earned Sylvan On Fire a merit rating of 91 and considering she shoulders a modest 56kg; a massive 4.5kg less than her main danger Fort Ember, a loss becomes highly unlikely.
