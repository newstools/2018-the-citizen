Five trial-awaiting prisoners escaped while they were being transported from Haenertsburg police station near Tzaneen to Polokwane on Wednesday.
Limpopo police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the five “allegedly jumped from the back of a moving police van in the city of Polokwane at corner Hospital and Landros Maree streets”.
“One prisoner, who was initially arrested for house robbery committed in the Haenertsburg Policing area, was re-arrested shortly after the escape. The remaining four escapees who were arrested for different crimes which they committed in the Haenertsburg Policing precinct are still at large,” he said.
Ngoepe said the escapees were identified as follows:
