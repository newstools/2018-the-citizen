Khanyi Mbau has moved into a new space, launching her own alcohol brand.
I Am Khanyi is being marketed as a “millennial shimmer gin”.
According to its marketing material, the gin has an “edible shimmer” that is meant to create a “liquid dance” on your tongue.
Twitter, unsurprisingly, was unimpressed, throwing shade at Khanyi, mainly over the gin’s name, which one user said sounded more like perfume.
Of course, tweeps also couldn’t resist joking about how the gin might cause those who drink it to gain a lighter complexion, much like Mbau herself has famously had hers permanently lightened.
According to Mbau herself, the gin is meant to cause those who drink it to lighten up, if not in the way those shading her have suggested.
“We have been through so much as a country and have little moments to celebrate this year,” she gave ZAlebs as her reason for launching the product.
