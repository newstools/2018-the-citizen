Each year in October and November, Johannesburg and Pretoria residents are treated to a spectacle of flowering Jacaranda trees, decorating the province in a swathe of purple blossoms.
Many say it is one of the highlights of living in Gauteng, even attracting international tourists who book tours to view the display.
