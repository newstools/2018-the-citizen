The Movement for Democratic Change says that its leader, Nelson Chamisa, has reportedly avoided being kidnapped a gang of armed men.
According to a report on eNCA, Chamisa’s motorcade was blocked by one of six vehicles as he was returning to Harare.
Armed men allegedly tried to remove the MDC leader from his vehicle once it was blocked, but Chamisa’s security detail foiled their attempts.


The MDC is blaming the attempted kidnapping on Zimbabwe’s Central Intelligence Organisation.
