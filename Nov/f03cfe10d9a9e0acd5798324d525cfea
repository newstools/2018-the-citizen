Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi on Saturday officially opened the new road connecting the Mozambican capital Maputo and KwaZulu-Natal, the provincial transport department said.
“The road will see the travel time between Maputo to Kosi Bay, KwaZulu-Natal’s East Coast border post, drastically reduced from six hours to 90 minutes. This is a huge achievement. It will boost trade and tourism between South Africa and Mozambique,” the department said in a brief statement posted on the Arrive Alive website.
