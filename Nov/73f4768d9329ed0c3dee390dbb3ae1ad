The statement reads: “Having invited applicants and called for nominations for the position of the NDPP, the panel received 22 applications and 24 nominations by the close of business on 2 November 2018.”
The panel met on Thursday evening November 8 to draw up a short list of candidates from the applications and nominations received.
