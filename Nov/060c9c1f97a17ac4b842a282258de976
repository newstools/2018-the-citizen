The next moment he was surrounded by seven males who opened fire with AK 47 rifles and 9mm pistols. He realised that it was an armed robbery and drew his weapon.
During the shootout, he managed to get out of his vehicle and returned fire. Unfortunately, he had to retreat while firing as the armed men tried to surround him.
He then hid behind a vehicle caught up in the traffic when he took a bullet in the arm.
Kenny is currently recovering in the Netcare Union Hospital in the Trauma Unit.
