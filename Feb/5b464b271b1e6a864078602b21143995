The South African Communist Party is mourning the death of the party’s Limpopo chairman Teenage Monama, the SACP in the province said on Sunday.
Monama died on Saturday night after a short illness while hospitalised in Polokwane. The SACP conveyed its heartfelt condolences to the Monama family, the community of his home town Modimolle, and the whole of the movement, the SACP said in a statement.
“Monama was a founder member of the Congress of South African Students in 1979. He fiercely fought against apartheid in the 1980s and 1990s until the apartheid government was dislodged in 1994.
“He was imprisoned by the apartheid regime for two years for refusing to testify against his fellow comrades. After his prison term he skipped the country to join the joint SACP and ANC military wing uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) in Angola. He returned from exile in 1991.”
Monama served in several capacities in the SACP, ANC, and the MK Military Veterans Association. He was elected as MKMVA deputy national chairman. At the time of his death he was serving as SACP Limpopo provincial chairman and by virtue of the responsibility, an ex-officio member of the party’s central committee. Monama is survived by children, grandchildren, and his mother, the SACP said.
