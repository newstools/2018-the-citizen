“There were 118 illegal immigrants arrested.
“They either had no permits or their permits have expired and they have not renewed them,” says Springs police spokesperson Capt Johannes Ramphora.
The raid was part of normal police operations.
The hotel is still operating as their operating licenses were still valid and they complied with the law.
The raids will continue for the foreseeable future and the police will be going from building to building.
“Those arrested will have to follow procedure and they will soon appear in court”, says Ramphora.
