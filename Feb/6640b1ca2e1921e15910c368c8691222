African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has chosen Human Settlements minister Lindiwe Sisulu as his preferred deputy president of the ANC.
However, late last year it seemed that Minister of Science and Technology, Naledi Pandor, was Ramaphosa’s deputy of choice.
TimesLIVE reports that after Ramaphosa announced Pandor’s suggested future position within the ANC, it took a few people by surprise. After the announcement, Ramaphosa held a meeting with allies to discuss the possibility of Pandor’s appointment.
What now seems to be set in stone is that Ramaphosa has chosen Sisulu over Pandor.
The Citizen reported in October last year that Sisulu was running her own presidential campaign when she made the list of preferred candidates for ANC deputy president. In this time, Ramaphosa’s lobbyists believed that she was entitled, annoying and arrogant.
“We have not yet taken a decision to kick out Lindiwe, but there are some discussions about whether to keep her on our list. She is showing her true colours even before she is elected. It’s like she is entitled, and it is irritating,” a source said.
In this time, Pandor was the preferred candidate.
Pandor’s clean record and experience within the ANC rendered her a strong candidate, according to ANC members such as ANC chief whip, Jackson Mthembu.
“Naledi Pandor is one of the trusted, clean deployees of the ANC in government; even in the national executive committee (NEC) she brings a fresh breather of political sense to any discussion,” Mthembu told City Press late last year.
Ramaphosa has since backtracked on this decision once again, with Sisulu leading the deputy president slot race.
If Sisulu is successful in being made ANC deputy president, she will be the second woman to hold this position.
