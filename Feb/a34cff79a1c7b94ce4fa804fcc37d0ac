It seems that ANC national executive committee (NEC) member Senzo Mchunu will not be in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s new Cabinet.
ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule on Sunday announced that the former KwaZulu-Natal party chairperson would work in a full-time position at Luthuli House as head of the organising subcommittee for the governing party.
Magashule was speaking to journalists on the sidelines of a special NEC meeting in Irene, Pretoria.
Former ANC North West secretary Dakota Legoete has also been appointed to serve in the committee with Mchunu.
Mchunu – a former leading campaigner for Ramaphosa in KZN – was speculated to be appointed as state security minister in Ramaphosa’s new Cabinet. The position is currently occupied by Bongani Bongo who was appointed in then president Jacob Zuma’s last controversial Cabinet reshuffle in October last year.
Zuma resigned as state president late on Wednesday February 14 after the NEC recalled him from office.
Speculation was rife that the NEC meeting would discuss the imminent Cabinet reshuffle and the selection of the country’s new deputy president since Ramaphosa was installed as president on February 15.
Magashule said Ramaphosa would discuss who he wanted to be his deputy in government with the ANC’s top six officials.
It is widely speculated that it would be filled by ANC deputy president David Mabuza.
Sources within the ANC NEC told The Citizen this week that Mabuza would like to see either Cooperative Governance MEC Refilwe Mtsweni or Education MEC Reginah Mhaule replace him as premier until the 2019 elections.
“It’s a done deal. DD [David Mabuza] is going to make his last Sopa on Friday. We know that he would like a female to replace him as premier,” the source said.
