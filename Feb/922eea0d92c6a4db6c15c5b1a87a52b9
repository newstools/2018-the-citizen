Proteas coach Ottis Gibson doesn’t want to consider handing Aiden Markram the captaincy in the ODI series loss to India as a mistake.
But he’s also not oblivious to the fact that the 23-year-old rookie opener, standing in for the injured Faf du Plessis, didn’t always look particularly comfortable on the field.
“Giving him the role was a decision for the future, not for the present,” Gibson said after South Africa slumped to a 73-run loss in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday night.
“I think it was the right decision. I’m not going to second guess myself. Aiden’s shown all the hallmarks of someone that’s going to going to be a good leader. We felt with Faf out that it would be a good time to give him that opportunity.”
Even if Markram gained some wisdom in terms of managing his team in the field and sharpening his decision-making skills in general, it can’t be denied that his batting suffered.
To date, he’s only made 103 runs in five innings at an average of just over 20.
In a current line-up that has a problem with batting depth, that’s actually something the Proteas can’t afford.
“We said at the start of the season that we would be looking a new players,” said Gibson.
“Aiden has shown some glimpses of his leadership ability. However, I’m not sure if this responsibility is perhaps a bit too much for him at the moment. It’s something I will have to review. It seems to me like he’s trying to bat in a way that is not the Aiden Markram I saw at the start of the season.”
The former West Indian fast bowler acknowledged that India had played excellent cricket throughout the series but also stated that the the home side, especially the batting, had been “very disappointing”.
“We’ve been exposed. I’ve told the lads that we’re not going to make excuses. We’re just going to get better. It’s been a good lesson we’ve been taught ahead of the World Cup next year.”
