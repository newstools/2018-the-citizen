A pedestrian, believed to be in his 20s, was killed when a minibus taxi somehow lost control and hit him as it veered off the road near Dassenhoek train station in Mariannhill in Durban on Saturday, paramedics said.
Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene just after 12.30pm to find the taxi off the road with the pedestrian lying next to the vehicle, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said.
“Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained major injuries; there was nothing paramedics could do for the man and he was declared deceased on the scene. The taxi driver had sustained minor injuries.”
The cause of the accident is unknown at this stage, Jamieson said.
