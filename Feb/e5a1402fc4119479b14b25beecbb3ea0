President Evo Morales said climate change had “shown up at Carnival, leaving disasters, with the loss of human lives and of homes.”

The pageant along the city’s cobblestones is a mixture of Spanish colonial traditions with those of the ancient indigenous Inca and Aymara peoples in a ritual seeking better farming and good health.
In 2001, the UNESCO cultural organization declared the carnival an intangible cultural heritage of humanity.
