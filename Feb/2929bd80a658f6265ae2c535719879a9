One community member, Sandile Mkhwanazi, said they wanted Mpose and her entire council out of Unizulu.
‘We have realised that those who are given an opportunity to be at helm, always view this institution as a cash cow from which they can enrich themselves financially, at the expense of the students and this community.
‘This institution has degenerated to an all-time low in the past three years.

‘We want the university to stop outsourcing the kitchen and security jobs. They must employ local residents not people from other areas.
‘About 62 catering employees lost their jobs because of outsourcing, and those outside companies do not employ local residents,’ he said, adding that there were no clear programmes aimed at developing the local community.
‘We want the university to hire 40% of local women, 30% of local youth, 20% of local men and 10% from other areas,’ said Mkhwanazi.
Another protester, Sisana Mkhwanazi said, she worked at Unizulu for almost 22 years in the catering department, but lost her job when the catering department was outsourced.
Receiving the memorandum, Nzimande promised protestors that he would forward it to the office of the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Professor Hlengiwe Mkhize.
