The latest employment data from Statistics South Africa shows that the Western Cape was the province that created the most jobs in the country.
Western Cape MEC for Economic Opportunities Alan Winde said according to the statistics, the Western Cape created 92,000 jobs in the last quarter of 2017.
“We also recorded the highest year-on-year increase in the number of jobs created, with 106,000 jobs added. The province has also once again recorded the lowest official unemployment rate, which now stands at 19.5%, against a national unemployment rate of 26.7%,” added Winde.
“This represents a 2.4% point decrease in unemployment in the province from the previous quarter. Among the key performing sectors in the quarter were finance, which saw quarterly growth of 8.3%, representing an addition of 35,000 jobs, and community and social services which recorded double-digit growth of 10.2%. While jobs in the agriculture sector in the province also saw quarter-on-quarter growth, this is largely due to the commencement of the harvest season.”
