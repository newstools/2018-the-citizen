A certain “dagga farmer” is not happy with the Hennops River neighbourhood watch and the police after they cleared out his entire stash dagga plants.

Members of the neighbourhood watch were engaged in a visibility operation over the weekend when they came across several dagga plants that were planted in a veld.
They immediately alerted the police and requested that they come and clear away the dagga plants.
Izak Pieterse, Chairperson of the Safety Portfolio of AfriForum’s Hennops River branch, said a full bakkie load of these plants were transported from the scene.
“We are grateful for a community that is involved with the safeguarding of their environment, as well for the excellent behaviour by the SAPS. An established and effective safety network is the key to combating crime,” Pieterse said.
He added that this is a good example of how effective safety institutions can be if they work together with the police to achieve a collective goal.

“Crime affects everyone and that is why we are making a plea to communities to increasingly become involved at the safety networks being created,” Lambert de Klerk, AfriForum’s District Coordinator for Gauteng North, said.
Lambert said the dagga plants were found about 2 km from the Hennops River and it was fenced.
So you think dagga is legal?
