Police say calm has been restored in eMbalenhle after violence erupted during a protest against Sasol and labour brokers this morning, February 8.
It is alleged members of eMbalenhle Community Forum members convened the strike and targeted workers who are not from the area.

Buses taking people to work were also targeted.
The protest came after the forum have had several meetings with Sasol during which they demanded jobs for locals.
The forum submitted a memorandum at the Sasol Sandton office in December, after meetings with both parties were held, but it seems the parties did not find a solution.
Sasol said in a statement today it was informed of protest action by members of the eMbalenhle Youth Forum taking place in the community, Ridge Times reports.
The company, however, was not formally notified of the protest action.
“Sasol always aims to build strong and mutually beneficial relationships with stakeholders based on openness, transparency and on mutual respect.
“We have structures in place to engage with the community and encourage the public to use these mediums to proactively discuss all issues.
“The company is dedicated to working with the community to find solutions to societal issues for the benefit of all.
“Sasol remains committed to the safety of its employees, contractors and the community.”
