Under-fire Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille will certainly not go down without a fight.
The former leader of the Independent Democrats yesterday enlisted the services of Advocate Dali Mpofu, the EFF national chairperson, as her legal representative as she launches an urgent high court application with regards to a motion of no confidence the city council will hear against her on Tuesday.
De Lille is facing corruption charges after the Democratic Alliance had earlier indicated that it wants her removed as mayor, following an internal party investigation – but primarily accusing her of covering up fraud and tender corruption.
De Lille is demanding a court order that councillors be allowed to vote by secret ballot on the motion, drawing comparisons with a similar application relating to a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma in the National Assembly last year.
On that occasion, Mpofu had argued for the United Democratic Movement (UDM) at the Constitutional Court.
“We are confident about our case and we are going to court,” said a determined De Lille yesterday. “A vote can never be free unless it is a secret.”
One gets the feeling that this will get a whole lot messier before it’s resolved. Both the DA and De Lille should expect no holds barred in the bitter feud.
