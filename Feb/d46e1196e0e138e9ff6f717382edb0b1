Someone reportedly heard a loud bang and immediately alerted police to the bombing.
The ATM was attached to the external wall of a church in Goedehoop Avenue.
Phathela said it is believed that a high-powered explosive device had been used in the blast which caused extensive damage to the machine.
“Although the machine was badly damaged, no money was stolen – apparently because the safe inside the ATM remained secured,” said Phathela.
