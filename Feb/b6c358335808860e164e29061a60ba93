The South African rand weakened by half a percent to 11.91 against the US dollar soon after President Jacob Zuma responded to the ruling African National Congress’s ultimatum to resign as head of state by Wednesday.
In a rambling television address on Wednesday, Zuma said the ANC had no cause to remove him from office and claimed that the party had reneged on an agreement that he would serve another three months as a notice period before handing over to his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa.
“I need to be furnished as to what I have done,” Zuma said, repeating at several turns that “there is no problem” and that he did not understand why the members of the ANC were bent on removing him. Zuma said he was not being defiant, but did not agree with the decision to recall him.
The ANC had signalled earlier that Zuma would be voted out by Parliament on Thursday if he refuses to resign of his own volition by Wednesday.
At around lunchtime before Zuma’s live TV interview, the rand had strengthened and quickly hit 11.80 before stabilising at 11.82. If the rand had breached 11.7975, it would have been at its strongest level in two and half years.
The local currency had fallen to 11.99 early on Tuesday as markets awaited the outcome of an ANC meeting on Zuma’s fate, before climbing to around 11.88 later in the day after the party said it was recalling him.
It is widely believed that when he leaves office and Ramaphosa, a former businessman preferred by investors, become the country’s new president, it will boost confidence in the markets and strengthen the local currency.
The rand, which has strengthened significantly since the ANC elected Ramaphosa to succeed Zuma as party leader in December, has traded nervously in recent weeks as Zuma resisted calls to quit.
