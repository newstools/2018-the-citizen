It is disturbing that members of the SA National Defence Force (SANDF) seconded to a United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been accused of brutality against civilians.
Although the accusations still have to be investigated and verified, the allegations are that South African peacekeepers sexually assaulted women and tortured males, including a 17-year-old boy.
The allegations have been sent to the United Nations, which is carrying out a joint investigation with the SANDF. What is worrying is that this is not the first time accusations of abuse have been levelled against South African peacekeepers on African missions.
Indeed, this country reportedly has one of the worst records of indiscipline in this area.
This sort of behaviour damages the image of the country and confirms the views of many in Africa who accuse us of being violent and xenophobic.
The inquiry must be conducted with speed, efficiency and fairness and, if there are those who are guilty of such abuses, they must be harshly punished.
At the same time, future peacekeepers need better training on how to deal with civilians and, frankly, how to behave in a disciplined, sensitive manner when operating in a foreign country.
