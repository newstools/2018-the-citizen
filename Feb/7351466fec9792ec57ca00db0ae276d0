Former president Jacob Zuma says when he was elected as the country’s head of state in 2009, he thought he was not deserving of the important task to lead the nation.
Zuma said this in his farewell speech to presidency staff on a drizzling Friday at the Union Buildings. He thanked staff for their hard work and dedication under his administration.
“In my own mind I thought there were many South Africans who deserved this more than me. But once people say, ‘do this’ I wouldn’t defy them.
“So I said, ‘well let me do it to the best of my ability’ and I’m sure as a human being, only God and Jesus don’t commit mistakes. I’m not sure about the angels,” Zuma said to bursts of laughter from the gathered staff.
