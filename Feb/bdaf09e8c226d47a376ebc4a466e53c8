Hurt, sad, and traumatised were some of the words used by Johannesburg metro police officers Joyce Seale and Jeanette Metsileng to describe their near-death experience on the night their colleagues, Winnie Mokgolo and Sophie Ngoasheng were killed.
Family and relatives gathered yesterday during an emotional wreath-laying ceremony at Witkoppen Road, where two officers were knocked down by a car and killed while at a roadblock.
Mokgolo’s aunt, Gloria, sobbed silently and said the 35-year-old was the family’s breadwinner and a single mother of three children, with the youngest being five.
Andrew Damari, the father of Ngoasheng’s two children, said the family were deeply hurt.
“Now my boys have to live without their mother because of a road user who decided to be reckless. It’s not fair,” he said.
An emotional Metsileng said: “I stopped a Porsche at the roadblock and I heard a terrible bang. I saw that a BMW had crashed into the Porsche. The BMW hit me, causing me to fall. “I am very sad. Officers Ngoasheng and Mokgolo adored their kids. I cannot imagine their pain. They always offered their services. I will miss them.”
Seale said they would continue to do their duty as police officers.
