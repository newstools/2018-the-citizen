After apologising to viewers last month for mistakenly announcing that IFP leader Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi had dead, SABC News anchor Peter Ndoro has done it again. This time declaring that the country’s newly elected President Cyril Ramaphosa dead.
On Thursday, Ndoro incorrectly said that Ramaphosa had died after former Thabo Mbeki commented on the death of Morgan Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe’s former prime minister and leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), who passed away on Wednesday after a long battle with colon cancer.
The video of the latest blooper has set Twitter abuzz with many people asking whether Ndoro has “issues” with death or whether he was exhausted from the breaking news stories of the week.
