The City of Cape Town on Tuesday announced that Day Zero, when the city’s taps run dry, has been pushed back to July 9.
Previously, Day Zero had been moved back from early April to June 4.
The City said the latest adjustment was due to a weekly drop in dam levels of only 0.5%, as compared to a 1.9% weekly drop in 2014.
“This week’s lower rate of consumption can be attributed to the Groenland water reaching Steenbras upper dam last week and slightly increasing the dam level, as well as to a further reduction in Cape Town’s weekly average demand to 523 megalitres per day (MLD), compared to 1 130 MLD in 2014,” said deputy mayor Ian Neilson in a statement.
Cape Town and other areas of the Western Cape are in the grips of a a devastating drought which has led to the implementation of severe water restrictions.
