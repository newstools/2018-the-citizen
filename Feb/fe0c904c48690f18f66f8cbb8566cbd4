Following the resignation of Jacob Zuma on the evening of 14 February 2018, the vacancy created in the presidency has been filled by Cyril Matamela Ramaphosa.
Cabinet spokesperson Phumla Williams announced that in terms of section 90(1) of the constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Ramaphosa automatically becomes the acting President of the country.
Ramaphosa remains the acting President of the Republic of South Africa until the National Assembly elects the new President of the Republic at a special sitting scheduled for this afternoon in Parliament.

The constitution doesnâ€™t require the deputy president to take the oath to assume the role of the acting President as he has already affirmed his faithfulness to the Republic.
