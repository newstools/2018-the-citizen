DA member of parliament Glynnis Breytenbach has been acquitted in the Pretoria North Magistrate’s Court on all charges against her.
The former state prosecutor faced charges relating to unauthorised access to, and modifying official laptop computer contents while she was still working at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).
Breytenbach and her former attorney, Gerhard Wagenaar, were charged with contravening the NPA Act, and defeating the ends of justice relating to unauthorised access to, and modifying, official laptop computer contents.
They were last year acquitted on the charges of defeating the ends of justice.
The charges came after documents were deleted in a mining rights case involving Imperial Crown Trading and Sishen Iron Ore, a subsidiary of Kumba Iron Ore, in which Breytenbach was involved during the time she worked for the specialised commercial crimes unit within the NPA.
Breytenbach always maintained she was unfairly targeted by officials with ulterior motives.
