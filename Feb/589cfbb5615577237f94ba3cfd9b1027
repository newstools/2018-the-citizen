Aiden Markram will bat in the crucial No 3 position in his first game as Proteas stand-in skipper in the second ODI against India in Centurion on Sunday.
Just a few days after Faf du Plessis said South Africa won’t pick two spinners in local conditions, the 23-year-old will now have two frontline tweakers at his disposal.
The in-form Tabraiz Shamsi will partner Imran Tahir as the hosts clearly feel India’s strategy worked in Durban.
Another notable development is the selection of Khaya Zondo, who’ll bat in the middle order.
India, unsurprisingly, won the toss and decided to field first again.
Why do anything else when you have such a stellar reputation as a chasing team?
Proteas: Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock, Aiden Markram (c), JP Duminy, David Miller, Khaya Zondo, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel, Tabraiz Shamsi, Imran Tahir.
