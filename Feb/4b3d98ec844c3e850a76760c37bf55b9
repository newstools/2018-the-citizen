A man, believed to be in his late 30s, was resuscitated after he was struck by lightning in the Midvaal area in Gauteng on Friday afternoon, paramedics said.
At about 4pm, the man was rushed to the Midvaal fire station by bystanders, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said.
“They explained to firefighters and ER24 paramedics that he was struck by lightning while sitting under a tree. Paramedics found that he barely showed signs of life and was resuscitated on [the] scene. A short while later his vital signs returned and he was placed on life support. Paramedics rushed him to Sebokeng Hospital for further medical care.”
Paramedics advised that people seek proper shelter during thunderstorms and avoid trees, large metal objects, or open fields, Vermaak said.
