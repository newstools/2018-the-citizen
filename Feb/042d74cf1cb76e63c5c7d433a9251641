Empangeni police are investigating a case of murder and an inquest after an 11-year-old boy allegedly playing with his father’s licensed firearm accidentally fired a shot, hitting his two-year-old sister, KwaZulu-Natal police said on Sunday.
“The victim was taken to hospital for medical attention where she later died. The brother allegedly turned the gun on himself after seeing what had happened to his sister,” Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said.
The incident apparently occurred at about 11.50pm on Saturday night, Mbhele said.
“We urge all licensed firearm owners to ensure that they do not violate the Firearms Control Act by failing to safeguard their firearms, because it amounts to a criminal act. Contravening the act may lead to unnecessary deaths and violators may face harsh prosecutions,” Mbhele said.
