Trillian Consulting was paid R155 million by Eskom for doing nothing, a forensic consulting company executive told parliament’s portfolio committee on public enterprises yesterday.
The committee is probing the mismanagement of funds in state-owned enterprises and Eskom, with its nearly R500 billion debt, is under the spotlight.
Yesterday, G9 Consulting and Advisory Services CEO Rajie Murugan said information and evidence uncovered during an investigation pointed towards possible corruption, money laundering and racketeering.
“G9 was appointed by Eskom’s Anti-Corruption and Forensic Unit, headed by Thembeka Ndaba, to investigate allegations by a whistle-blower in respect of two payments made to Trillian,” Murugan said.
Trillian was paid R134 million after the contract had stopped.
“So, senior people at Eskom take a submission to the board and say they should be paid an up front amount of R134 million.
“What’s more peculiar is that Edwin Mabelane then writes to Trillian to say please invoice us for R134 million. Well, it’s just about Christmas, flights are more expensive, let’s get R134 million for ourselves, our family and friends,” Murugan testified.
Invoices from Trillian in six months included R26 million, R107 million, R99 million, R134 million and R155 million.
“Trillian had no basis to benefit from gainshare. Apart from not even being legally there, they were not involved in assisting McKinsey in most of the workstreams so why should they then gain from that percentage McKinsey was paid,” Murugan said.
Murugan said the conduct and actions of one or more of the directors of Trillian throughout the entire process presented prima facie evidence of criminal conduct, fraud and money laundering.
