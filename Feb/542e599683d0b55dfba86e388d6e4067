The City of Johannesburg will on Thursday morning hold a memorial service for two female metro police officers who were fatally run over by a drunk driver at a roadblock they were manning in Fourways.
Mayor Herman Mashaba, MMC for Public Safety Councillor Michael Sun, chief of police David Tembe and officials from the department of public safety will hold a memorial service for the two Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) officers who passed away during an accident on Monday evening, said the City in a statement.
At 11am there will be a wreath-laying ceremony at the corner of Witkoppen and Cambridge roads, between Umhlanga Avenue and Hallam Road.
The City said a memorial service, which will be attended by families of the deceased, is scheduled for 1pm at the JMPD Training Academy in Booysens.
The tragedy occurred on Monday evening. Several JMPD officers were deployed to their usual roadside check-duty on Witkoppen Road near Monte Casino, and have pulled over three vehicles for a routine check when the driver of a double cab vehicle crashed into them.
Two of our female officers were fatally wounded; two other female officers, two passengers from the stopped vehicles as well as the driver of the double cab were seriously injured and taken to a hospital.
The driver of the double cab vehicle, who was found to be drunk has since been arrested.
