Valentine’s Day is a special day to many couples, and most go out of their way to show their partners how much they love them.
However, single women always feel left out.
We offer some budget-friendly ideas for you and your friends.
1. Make it a movie night
Watch a chick flick movie with your friends, or have a movie marathon in the comfort of your home.
2. Spoil yourself

Get yourself that red lipstick or shoes you have been dying for.
3. Catch up on series
Grab a bottle of your favourite wine, stay indoors and catch up on the series you did not have time to watch.
4. Relax at a spa

Go to a beauty spa and get pampered. You deserve it!
5. Take a break from social media
Forget about social media, just for a day. Seeing photos of couples, especially your exes, having a blast will depress you.
6. Enjoy a cheat treat

Forget about dieting; get that ice cream, slab of chocolate, pizza or frozen yoghurt.
7. Spread the love from above
Do something nice for someone else and just spread love. You will feel good afterwards.
8. Family matters
Cook a nice meal for your family. Or, even better, have a braai or go for a picnic with your girls.
9. Give yourself some love
Do anything that makes you happy and content.
