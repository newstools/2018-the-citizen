It would be a great pity if Congress of the People leader Mosiuoa “Terror” Lekota’s words in parliament – in response to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address – were drowned out by those who accuse him of selling out or, as one EFF accuser put it, “being bought by the fascists”.
The reality is that Lekota’s was the voice of reason in the midst of the euphoria generated by Ramaphosa’s announcement that the ANC government will go ahead with its commitment to redistribute land … and do so without compensation if necessary.
Lekota pointed out, quite correctly, that to do that would violate Section 25 of the Constitution, which guarantees that no one shall be deprived of their property and that, where there is expropriation, it must be with compensation.
Lekota also asked, poignantly, about those from whom land would be taken.
“Please tell us, who is [sic all] not our people in this country? Who is our people, who is not our people?”
To carry out his promises, Ramaphosa will have to amend the Constitution, or embark on illegal land grabs a la Zimbabwe.
Either way, the message being sent to the world, and specifically potential foreign investors, is a very negative one.
