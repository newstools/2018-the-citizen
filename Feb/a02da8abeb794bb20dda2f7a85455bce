Cyril Matamela Ramaphosa has been elected by Parliament as the new president of the Republic of South Africa.
Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng invited MPs to make nomination in terms of the constitutional provisions to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Jacob Zuma.
Ramaphosa was elected by two ANC MPs with no further nominations from the floor.
Mogoeng ignored COPE’s Mosioua Lekota’s contention that Ramaphosa is not eligible for nomination as the Constitutional Court has found him to have been in violation of his oath of office.
After the nomination, Mogoeng invited back the Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete to introduce the new president of the country to Parliament.
The sitting continues.
