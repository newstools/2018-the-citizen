Police in Sunnyside, on the eastern part of the Pretoria central business district, say they are making inroads in combating crime in the heavily populated area with the arrest of 20 people over a period of 48 hours.
“The police in Sunnyside are warning persons who flock into the area, for various reasons, to refrain from illegal activities because they will not be spared the rod due to their ignorance of the law,” said spokesperson for the Sunnyside police, Captain Daniel Mavimbela.
“The warning follows the arrest of 20 suspects during the crime prevention operations over the past 48 hours for offences like malicious damage to property, shoplifting, theft, possession of drugs and robbery.”
Mavimbela said the crimes bedevilling the Sunnyside area – synonymous with high rise flats and apartments – were however not limited to theft.
“While continuing to scan the local streets for suspicious persons and motor vehicles, the police came across two motorists who were involved in an argument following a collision. They discovered that one of the drivers, a 56-year-old man from Pretoria central, was allegedly intoxicated. He was arrested,” said Mavimbela.
“In a separate incident, a 50-year-old woman was jailed after she was reportedly caught with dagga inside her motor vehicle. Other three elders aged between 40 and 50 were also arrested for possession of dagga. All the arrested suspects are expected to have appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate’s [Court] by Wednesday.”
Mavimbela appealed to members of the public to be cautious before operating or displaying their cellphones in public spaces around Sunnyside.
“Unknown and suspicious persons hanging around or frequenting neighbourhoods should be reported to the police for intervention because others could be drug dealers, robbers or thieves.”
