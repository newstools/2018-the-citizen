Opposition leader Mmusi Maimane on Thursday told newly elected President Cyril Ramaphosa the ruling African National Congress could not distance itself from the actions of his predecessor because the party had protected him for nine years.
“What is wrong with South Africa is not Jacob Zuma, it is the ANC,” Maimane said.
He began his address to Ramaphosa by saying that the Democratic Alliance would work with him “as best we can” if he were to act in the interests of South Africa.
But he went on to say the ANC was complicit in Zuma’s legacy as it had voted against nine motions of no confidence brought against him by the opposition.
Maimane added that the opposition would press ahead with a motion calling for Parliament to be dissolved and the country to head to the polls to elect a new government.
