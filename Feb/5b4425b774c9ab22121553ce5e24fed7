Jacob Zuma has left the building.
No he hasn’t. Yes, he has … It would be comic if it were not, in reality, a national tragedy that President Zuma still clings to his position, long after he has outstayed his political welcome – not only in the eyes of his own party, the ANC, but in the eyes of most South Africans.
The ANC announced yesterday it had decided to “recall” Zuma from the highest office in the land, just as it did with Thabo Mbeki in 2008.
But then it stopped short of giving any details which would allow South Africans to understand what was likely to happen in the wake of the announcement.
ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule – one of those who staunchly supported Zuma – added to the confusion yesterday at the press conference where the recall was announced.
He said Zuma had not been given an ultimatum to resign, then went on to suggest that the president would, today, do so. But, he insisted, it was not an ultimatum.
The muddying of the waters and the double-speak was something which characterised the Zuma administration, with him and his clique perfecting the art of ducking and diving, avoiding responsibility and diverting attention.
The lack of clarity is not good for the country, particularly as it leaves a host of unanswered questions.
What will happen if he refuses to go? Will there be an impeachment? Will the ANC apply to have a vote of no confidence in him debated in parliament?
What will happen to his acolytes, both inside and outside government? What will happen to the charges against him and to the probe into state capture.
Mr Zuma, why don’t you break the habit of a decade? Why don’t you surprise us and do the right thing?
Leave while you still have a grain of dignity.
EFF says it will forge ahead with motion of no confidence in Zuma
