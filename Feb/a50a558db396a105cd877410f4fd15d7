South African Revenue Service (Sars) customs officials have seized crystal methamphetamine worth R18 million in passengers’ luggage at OR Tambo International Airport.
In a statement Tuesday, Sars said the drugs were seized in two separate busts in recent days.
A person was arrested on Saturday when custom officials were scanning a male passenger’s luggage who had arrived in South Africa from Nairobi, Kenya.
Sars spokesperson Sandile Memela said: “They noticed suspicious objects in his three bags and conducted a further search, subsequently discovering 12 plastic bags containing a white powdery substance.
“Drug tests confirmed that the substance was crystal methamphetamine valued at R17,202,000.”
The suspect and the drugs was handed over to the South African Police Service (Saps) for further investigation.
In a separate incident on Friday, officials discovered a parcel that was declared as “gifts” to be couriered to Malaysia.
Upon further inspection, officials discovered sachets that contained a white crystal substance which a drug test later confirmed to be crystal methamphetamine valued at just under R1 million.
The case was handed over to Saps for further investigation.
