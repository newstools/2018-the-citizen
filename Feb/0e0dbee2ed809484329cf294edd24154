It was Hong Kong’s first “sausage walk”, emulating popular mass dachshund get-togethers in Britain.
The band of excitable dogs and their owners carved a path through the heart of the city on a chilly morning, taking in footbridges, seafood markets and roadside temples en route. 
Organiser Mat Gallagher said he had been inspired to get owners and dogs together after adopting 10-year-old rescue dachshund Jai Jai six months ago.

“They’re very cool dogs, very chilled out. He’s very relaxed and likes to be with people,” Gallagher said, holding Jai Jai, who was sporting a fleece-lined grey tweed hoodie with leather buckles. 
The group congregated first at one of the city’s few dog parks, on its famous harbour front.
As they embarked on their walk, they ran the gamut of delivery drivers, loaded trolleys and Saturday shoppers on the streets of the busy Sheung Wan neighbourhood. 
“Hong Kong is not a dog-friendly city,” said Ivan Lo, who had brought dachshunds Kaka and CC for the walk. 
“But they are good friends for us, for humans, so we still want to own one.”
Gallagher said he hoped 2018 would see improvements in Hong Kong’s canine landscape — the walk ended in a dog-friendly cafe.  
For Isabella Redmayne, six, who came with dog Boris, the pleasures of owning a dachshund were simple. 
“He’s six-years-old like I am and he licks me on my face. He likes to go to sleep on his blanket and he’s really soft,” she said, adding that she hoped he would make new friends Saturday.
