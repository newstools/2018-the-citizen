The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) has reached an agreement with the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) to bring to an end a four-day strike over entry salary levels, and also announced a once off gratuity ranging from R4 500 to R8 500 for all employees.
Nehawu general secretary Zola Saphetha said the package, which workers accepted as the basis for suspending the strike, contains agreements to address salary anomalies for entry level administrators to be moved from R175 156 per annum to R209 421 per annum.
Entry level for senior finance administrators will move from R209 156 per annum to R289 336 and entry level for board committee specialists to be moved from R289 336 per annum to R359 313.
“The change of entry levels came with a victory that those already in the employ in such posts means the change of salaries will be backdated to November 1, 2017,” said Saphetha. “The agreement also includes the permanent absorption of 75 contract employees.”
Saphetha said the other important victory was that of the development of a sexual harassment policy and review of recruitment policy.
