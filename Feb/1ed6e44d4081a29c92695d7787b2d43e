Plettenberg Bay residents, as well as family and friends of murdered hospice nurse Penny Cumming, could barely contain their outrage when the man – accused of raping and killing the 63-year-old Schoongezicht Country Estate resident last month – told the court he wanted to be released on bail to open a takeaway shop in Qolweni, Plettenberg Bay, and help drug-addicted children clean up their act, Knysna-Plett Herald reports.

Those gathered in the packed gallery further murmured their horror when the suspect said he was willing to pay R1 000 for his freedom.
This did however not happen, as he was denied bail in the Plettenberg Bay Magistrates’ Court on 21 February.
During his time in the witness stand, the 30-year-old suspect, calmly and confidently told the court of his chequered past including run-ins with the law, including theft and domestic violence, and drug abuse.
The suspect, who cannot be named before he has pleaded, was arrested on 30 January – where he was allegedly hiding near a school in Kwanokuthula – following the grisly discovery on January 29.
Cumming’s naked and bruised body was found on the floor of her home by a friend.
Her home was ransacked and her Volvo SUV was missing.
The vehicle, which was partially destroyed, was found near Nekkies in Knysna later that day.
