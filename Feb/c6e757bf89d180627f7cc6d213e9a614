Former president Jacob Zuma faces several charges of fraud, racketeering, corruption, money laundering and tax evasion.
According to Sunday Times, the NPA is intent on bringing back the charges relating to the arms deal and his former adviser Shabir Sheik. Under the authority of Abrahams, the anti-corruption unit has already lined up 200 witnesses to testify against the embattled leader who was pushed to resign by the ANC on Thursday.
One of the witnesses, the Sunday Times reports is a Pretoria based lawyer, Ajay Sooklal who said he had been approached by the NPA and had agreed to offer his testimony.
Two sources said the charges would be reinstated in a few days, as the NPA was considering the matter urgently.
“Zuma is going to have his day in court soon and it’s going to be ugly.”
“It is just a matter of days, Zuma is going to be charged,” two sources said.
In addition, Zuma is also facing possible disciplinary action from the ANC after he refused to step down. Two weeks ago, the ANC’s top six were locked in talks with him and when asked to resign willingly, he rejected their proposal.
After an NEC meeting in which it was agreed that Zuma should step down and President Cyril Ramaphosa become head of state, Zuma publicly said he did not agree with their decision and later resigned on the same day.
It is understood that this has angered the ruling party, and plans are underway to discuss the way forward on instituting a disciplinary hearing against Zuma.
