The bail application of the man who allegedly drove into and killed two Johannesburg Metro Police (JMPD) was postponed on Thursday by the Alexandra Magistrates’ Court.
Magistrate Renier Boshoff said: “I want pictures of the scene to see if the police were visible. Were there blue lights or not?”
The accused, Albert Pretorius, 41, allegedly drove through a roadblock on Witkoppen, and was found to be under the influence of alcohol. He is facing two charges of culpable homicide and driving under the influence of alcohol after the deaths of Winnie Mokgolo, 35, and Sophie Ngoasheng, 45. The officers were buried earlier this week.
Through an affidavit that was read by his legal representative, Hloni Mashifani, Pretorious said he was married and worked as a radio frequency supervisor and resided in Paulshof.
His legal representative said he did not have to deal with the merits of the case, and was not yet prepared to say whether his client was pleading guilty or not.
“I have been informed of my rights to remain silent,” the affidavit stated.
Pretorius said during December 2017, he experienced a pinch in his right leg up to his back and contacted a chiropractor who prescribed him with medication.
“On the night in question I was on the medication and consumed three alcoholic beverages.”
He said he drove at 80km/h, and the visibility of the road was affected by darkness.
“I recall being assaulted by several metro police officers with closed fists and after a lapse of time I was handcuffed to a fence adjacent to the road. It was at that time I saw emergency personal coming to the scene.”
State prosecutor Godfrey Maphiri told the court that drunken driving was condemned by the law.
Boshoff requested that pictures of the scene be furnished to the court to determine whether it was lit or not.
