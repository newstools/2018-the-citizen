When ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene shortly before 6am, the fire brigade had extricated the man, ER24 spokeswoman Ineke van Huyssteen said.
“He was found to be in a critical condition, but despite the efforts of paramedics on the scene, he succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead by ER24. The driver of the other vehicle sustained no injuries,” she said.
