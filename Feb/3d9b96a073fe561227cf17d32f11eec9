President Jacob Zuma has reportedly summoned Cabinet ministers to a special meeting expected to take place in Cape Town today, eNCA reports. However, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has denied on Twitter that the meeting has been called.


Tomorrow the ANC’s highest decision-making body, the national executive committee (NEC), is due to meet to discuss Zuma’s future as pressure mounts on him to step down.
On Sunday, Zuma refused to resign voluntarily during a meeting with the ANC’s top six officials, which led to the party’s national working committee (NWC) meeting, which has now elevated the matter to the NEC.
This is a developing story. More to follow.
