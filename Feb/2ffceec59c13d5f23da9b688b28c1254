In Harding’s short film, Place of Sweet Waters, he highlights Cape Town’s largely untapped fresh water springs, Northcliff Melville Times reports. Research suggests that there are about 25 springs and four underground rivers flowing under the City, while the City of Cape Town has only 13 springs on their records.
Harding says that through this film he wanted to highlight how this naturally occurring resource has been largely untapped, and wasted, for decades.
The film was produced as part of a global sH2Orts film competition run by WaterAid and the Public Media Alliance’s WorldView project, with the aim of documenting the future of water.
