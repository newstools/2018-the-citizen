The most noteworthy aspect of the plan by new President Cyril Ramaphosa to institute lifestyle audits for all politicians and public officials is the fact that this is only being done now.
It should have been implemented years ago.
Perhaps, had the system been in operation and had it been applied with diligence, we might not have had to endure the rampant thieving which has become commonplace.
Given that our previous number one citizen has been accused of being at the centre of a web of state capture and corruption – and that he and his cronies seemed to continue with impunity and arrogance – is it surprising that many others followed his example?
Had a system of lifestyle monitoring been in place – comparing the known income of a specific person with the cost of his or her apparent way of life – then people would have been reluctant to stick their hands into the taxpayer cookie jar.
Politicians and civil servants are there to serve the people, not enrich themselves. Let’s hope that becomes the cardinal rule of the new Ramaphosa administration.
And, while we’re on about it, Mr President: what about trimming all those perks and benefits?
