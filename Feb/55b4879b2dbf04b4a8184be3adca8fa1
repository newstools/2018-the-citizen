Social grant beneficiaries are expected to see slightly higher increases in the amount of money they receive from government to offset an increase in value-added tax, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Wednesday.
“Government has taken deliberate steps to adjust social grant values above inflation to at least partially cover for the proposed increase in Vat,” Gigaba said in his budget speech which he tabled in Parliament.
Pensioners will see their grants increase from R1,600 to R1,690 by April 1 and by another R10 by October 1.
The child support grant will increase by R20 from R380 to R400, and by another R10 come October 1.
“An additional R2.6 billion has been added since the medium-term budget policy statement to social grants to enable these changes.
