South Africa urgently needs to get investment back on the agenda in order to attract capital and help grow the mining sector and the economy in general, Anglo American deputy chairperson Norman Mbazima said on Monday.
“While we may have one of the world’s most endowed mining jurisdictions, we have not been able to bring this endowment to account,” Mbazima told the annual “mining indaba” conference in Cape Town.
“We need to attract capital for South Africa’s mining industry, whether foreign or domestic, and we must accept that such capital needs to get a competitive return.”
