Internet penetration in Tanzania increased in the past six years,. It reached 45 per cent in 2017 from 17 per cent in 2012, the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) statistics for the fourth quarter show. During the period, the number of internet users has been progressively growing, reaching 23 million people in 2017 from 7.52 million in 2012.

Supporting the fact, statistics also indicate that Internet users who used mobile wireless were 19.01 million in 2017. Meanwhile, fixed wireless and fixed wired recorded 3.46 million and 520,698 internet users during the year 2017 respectively. “The number of internet users by mobile wireless service was higher than that of fixed wireless and wired devices (when the two were combined together) by 79.01 per cent in 2017,” the report shows. As of March 31, 2011, the estimated total number of Internet users was 2.095 billion (30.2 per cent of world population). It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet carried only 1 per cent of the information flowing through two-way telecommunication, by 2000 this figure had grown to 51 per cent, and by 2007. more than 97 per cent of all telecommunicated information was carried over the Internet.
