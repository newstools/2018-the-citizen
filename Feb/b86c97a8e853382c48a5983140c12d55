African National Congress secretary-general Ace Magashule and his deputy, Jessie Duarte, are reportedly meeting with President Jacob Zuma this morning at his official Pretoria residence, Mahlamba Ndlopfu.
SABC News reports that two vehicles bearing Free State number plates believed to be transporting Magashule arrived at the president’s residence this morning. It’s been speculated that Magashule and Duarte are meeting Zuma to deliver the ANC’s recall letter to him personally.
This after the national executive committee (NEC) – the ANC’s highest decision-making body between conferences – resolved to recall Zuma as state president following a marathon meeting of the ANC’s top structure at St George Hotel in Irene, near Pretoria. However, Zuma is understood to have offered to resign, but only in July, something the ANC refused to entertain.
Earlier, the ANC said it had delayed its announcement on Zuma’s fate because it needed more time to inform its branches of the decision taken by the NEC. The media briefing has been postponed to 2pm this afternoon.
