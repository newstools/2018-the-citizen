A Helderkruin resident, Heidi Labuschagne, is in a serious condition in Life Flora Clinic after she jumped from the second storey of her home to escape two home invaders, Roodepoort Record reports.
According to one source, Labuschagne was relaxing at her home in the Sunny Rock Estate on Watson Street on Friday 23 February when she was surprised by two male intruders in the house. After first severely assaulting her they tried to take her upstairs to the bedroom. To escape the nightmare of a potential rape, she jumped from the second floor.
