While President Cyril Ramaphosa is understood to have extended an olive branch to Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, indicating that he would like her to serve in his Cabinet, she has declined.
Sunday Times reports that Dlamini-Zuma said she is tired and wants out of politics though she will remain a member of the national executive committee and the national working committee.
“She told them [Ramaphosa and Magashule] that while she always abides by the will of the ANC, this is one time she won’t. She just wants to leave,” a source told Sunday Times.
Dlamini-Zuma was appointed an MP after ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe resigned late last year. Her term as African Union chairperson ended at the beginning of 2017. It was reported last week that Dlamini-Zuma was keen to serve under Ramaphosa with several political analysts stating it was in her best interests to do so.
According to Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus, Dlamini-Zuma still refuses to be dragged into factionalism that reared its ugly head before the December ANC national conference Since the conference, she has been quiet about where she stood with regards to Zuma.
“She is doing what she promised to do – to accept the outcomes and move on. You are not likely to hear anything else from Dr Dlamini-Zuma. She is loyal to the ANC,” Niehaus said.
