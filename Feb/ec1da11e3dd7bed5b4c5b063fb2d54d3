Two men who were found guilty of the murder of a 35-year-old man have been sentenced to life imprisonment in the Botshabelo Regional Court in the Free State, police said on Monday.
Police spokesperson Sergeant Martin Xuma said: “It was on 3 July 2016 at about 20:45 when the victim, Vusi Johannes Molotsi, was visiting a friend in Section L, Botshabelo. As they were sitting there was a knock on the door and the victim went to open. He noticed that it was his girlfriend and he told his friend that he is leaving as he needs to talk to his girlfriend.”
The sergeant said shortly after they left, the friend was informed by his neighbours that the victim who was just at his place was now  being assaulted by people. He quickly went out to look and found his friend with open wounds on his head. Police and emergency medical services were summoned to the scene.
“Victim was taken to a local hospital and died upon arrival. Case of murder was opened for investigation and assigned to Detective Constable Molahlwe Maqekoane from Botshabelo Detective,” Xuma said.
“Upon preliminary investigation it emerged that the victim took the girlfriend’s cellphone and the girlfriend brought along her brother and a friend who were there to assist the girlfriend to get her cellphone back.
“An argument started and the duo, namely Tankiso Tsubane, aged 22, and Goitsemang Morabe, aged 22, assaulted the victim with knobkerries. Constable Maqekoane followed on the information received and managed to apprehend the duo in July 2016,” Xuma said.
The pair were found guilty for murder and sentenced to life imprisonment last week Thursday.
