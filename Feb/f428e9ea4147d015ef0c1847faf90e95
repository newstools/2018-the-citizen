Fresh claims from the Democratic Alliance (DA) that a number of South African Police Service (SAPS) officers have got criminal records is a huge concern.
After a reply to a parliamentary question that revealed there were 57 such SAPS members serving in the family violence, child protection and sexual offence (FCS) units, the DA urged Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to take immediate action.
According to DA spokesperson Zakhele Mbhele, some of these crimes included “at least three cases of culpable homicide, seven of common assault, two of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, and one instance of pointing a firearm”.
Driving under the influence, reckless or negligent driving, fraud, loss of firearms, defeating the ends of justice and theft were some of the other crimes.
“These people should not be working with children or the victims of domestic or sexual violence. It is clear that they cannot be trusted with the responsibility of addressing the extremely high levels of violence against women and children,” said Mbhele.
The South African Police Service is meant to serve and protect its people. Employing officers with criminal records is not doing that.
