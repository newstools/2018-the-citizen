Despite a parliamentary process that culminated in an interministerial committee (IMC) getting involved to broker a deal between South African Post Office (Sapo) and South African Social Security Agency (Sassa), the service provider in the middle of the storm believes it has a shot at tendering for future work.
Asked if Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) plans to tender for a contract already politically awarded to the Post Office, Bridget von Holdt, a business director at Burston-Marsteller – a PR company for CPS – stated that “although the SAPA [sic] claimed publically [sic]that they had the capabilities to handle the tender”, the recent Constitutional Court “order now means that CPS can tender on any of them”.
Von Holdt was also asked to explain what CPS was planning on doing going forward in relation to the ConCourt ruling, and she wrote: “Based on the ConCourt ruling, CPS has the right to tender.  They reserve their rights, and have not decided as yet if they will be tendering.”
