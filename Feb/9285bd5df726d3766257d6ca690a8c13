Tom Moyane, the commissioner for the South African Revenue Services (Sars), on Tuesday welcomed and congratulated Nhlanhla Nene on his reappointment as the new finance minister.
Nene was reappointed in a Cabinet reshuffle announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Union Buildings on Monday night.
Moyane said that Sars leadership has had a collegial and effective working relationship with Nene before.
“The return to the portfolio provides yet another opportunity for Sars to strengthen its effective working relationship with Minister Nene and the National Treasury in the effort to successfully collect revenue to support the government’s developmental agenda,” Moyane said in a statement.
“Sars appreciates Minister Nene’s passion, experience and insightful leadership which will enhance the organization’s commitment to being an efficient and effective tax authority.”
Moyane said that Nene’s leadership will further galvanize the Sars workforce and boost morale in a challenging economic environment.
Meanwhile, Sars on Monday crossed the psychological threshold of the R1-trillion mark in revenue collection following the upward increase of the revenue target to R1,217.3 billion recently.
