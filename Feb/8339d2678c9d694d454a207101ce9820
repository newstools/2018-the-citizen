Three people were injured, two seriously, when two cars collided head-on on the SPCA Access Road in Cato Manor in Durban on Friday night, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said.
“Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene just after 9.30pm to find the entire road blocked,” Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said.
‘Three people had sustained injuries from minor to serious and were stabilised on the scene by advanced life support paramedics before being transported to various Durban hospitals for the further care that they required.”
