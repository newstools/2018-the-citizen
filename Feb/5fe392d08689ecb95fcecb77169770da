Despite Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba saying that the African Nation Congress (ANC) is trying to fight the insourcing of the City’s security guards, the party said it has nothing against insourcing, Randburg Sun reports.
Mashaba issued a statement earlier this week in which he stated that he was informed that the ANC’s apparent open opposition to the idea of insourcing stems from scores of lucrative security contracts handed out to their ‘tenderpreneurs.’

“Unfortunately the ANC is now resorting to peddling lies to undermine this process in their efforts to continue the oppression of security personnel in the City in favour of tenderpreneurs.
“The fact that the ANC has the temerity to talk about such matters while we are still cleaning up their rampant legacy of looting is beyond hypocrisy. To this day, this has never been admitted to and the people of our City are yet to receive an overdue apology from the ANC.”
But ANC spokesperson in Joburg, Jolidee Matongo, told Randburg Sun that the party supports the idea of insourcing. They were concerned, he said, about the way in which the process was started.
“Due diligence was not done. There must be a proper study conducted, the financial implications assessed and the organisation structure determined. This study should then be presented in council,” Matongo explained.
He was concerned, he said, that at the end of the day the 4 000 security guards would have to be retrenched because the City cannot afford the exercise.
The insourcing of security personnel will begin at the end of March, the mayor said.
