All drivers will start with zero points and the maximum permissible number of points is twelve.
A person is allowed to drive until they have twelve points. Every point exceeding the limit results in a three-month suspension of the licence.
Points are allocated to drivers and cars based on infringements and demerit points will be deducted at a rate of one point every three months provided no points have been incurred over that period.
A license is cancelled when it is suspended for the third time. The Bill was referred to the Committee on November 30, 2015 (ATC No. 161-2015), the Committee held public hearings and considered proposed amendments to the Bill. This is why they had to extend the public consultations.
