Maughan has resigned from the 24-hour news television channel for unknown reasons.
She has worked at eNCA for eight years, and has made a name for herself as one of South Africa’s star legal reporters.
The broadcaster released a statement expressing sadness over losing Maughan as a full-time staff member.
“Karyn has been a dedicated, astute and professional journalist covering some of the biggest news stories for eNCA over the past 8 years, including the Oscar Pistorius trial. However, we are pleased to say that our relationship with Karyn will continue, with her appearing on-air in various capacities,” read the statement.
Maughan also confirmed the news of her resignation on Twitter. She has not cited her reasons for leaving or revealed her plans for the future.
“My last day at eNCA is 28 February. I’ve had a great time there and will miss my colleagues very much. But this is the right decision,” she said.


Several South Africans have voiced their disappointment at Maughan’s departure. Others, including Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, wished her well in her future endeavors.
