Gibson also indicated that although a significant portion of the money was recovered, the unlawful use of explosives remained a key concern across the country. “Our primary concern is always the well-being of our own employees and the protection of our client’s assets, and the use of explosives is a worrying trend which remains unchecked,” he said.
Meanwhile, Minister of Police Bheki Cele announced 42 suspects linked to CIT robberies were arrested during a media briefing at Tembisa Police Station on Thursday.
