The gist of the email is that property owners will have to keep on paying their bonds even if their property is expropriated without compensation.
“It is important to note the Home Loan agreement is subject to a contractual agreement, and bond payments remain due and payable until such time that the bond is paid in full irrespective of any form of land expropriation – with or without compensation. We would encourage you to continue with the bond payments until such time a determination is made,” the email reads.
Molopyane indicated that she will respond with a clarification of the content of the email in due course.
