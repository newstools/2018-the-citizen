The farm’s caretaker saw cut wire on the ground and after investigating, he stumbled upon the devastating scene. 
The heads and paws of two of the lionesses were removed, which is what flagged the suspected motive to be muti-related. The third lioness was found with her head and paws.

Vultures who began eating the carcasses also died. Members of the endangered species association, as well as the anti-poaching association, rushed to the scene, where they took DNA samples for testing. 
A piece of meat suspected of being used to poison the lionesses was also found and handed in for testing. The case has had no leads thus far.
