A report that BMW is considering a four-cylinder engine for its next-generation i8’s hybrid powertrain has emerged.
This comes after persistent rumours about the future of the i8’s powertrain, with some people pointing to an all-electric future and others hinting at a more powerful hybrid system.
Currently, the i8 features a three-cylinder petrol engine and an electric motor with a total output power of 275kW and 570Nm.
According to BMW Blog, BMW could be working on a more potent hybrid setup, possibly a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine with 223kW, before adding in extra power from electric motors.
Earlier rumours raised the possibility of a pure battery-powered i8 with about 559kW and an improved driving range.
It is still early to confirm these rumours, however, if approved, a redesigned model is unlikely to arrive until 2022 or later.
