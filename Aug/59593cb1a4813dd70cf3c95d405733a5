The South African currency plummeted to new lows on Friday as government bonds weakened amid global trade tensions and slides in the Russian ruble and Turkish lira, which combined to dampen global market enthusiasm towards emerging market assets.
The US-China trade spat has had a negative impact on global growth, leaving the rand and other emerging market currencies on the back foot.
Turkey’s lira and the Russian rouble were hit hardest, according to analysts, with the lira hitting a new record low against the US dollar on Friday.
Turkey sent a delegation to Washington to discuss the trade crisis, but returned with no clear solution, sparking concerns of a widening rift between the nation and the US.
