Hawks national head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya on Friday “strongly condemned” the arrest of five police officers from Beacon Bay Police Station in Eastern Cape for alleged fraud and corruption after stolen goods were recovered from police quarters.
The five police officers, together with a sixth accomplice, a taxi driver, allegedly conspired and looted a truck which was involved in an accident between East London and Macleantown on Tuesday afternoon.
“We will continue to confront any form of corruption and criminality in the SAPS precisely because we are of the firm belief that both forms of criminal behaviour have no place in our existence,” said Lebeya.
“The SAPS has always adopted a zero-tolerance attitude towards corruption and we will leave no stone unturned in ensuring a corrupt – free service that seeks to provide an efficient and quality service to all our communities.”
Hawks national spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the police officers and the taxi driver allegedly helped themselves to perishable goods from the truck using a police vehicle as well as a taxi.
“The Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation unit received a tip-off and, together with Crime Intelligence, promptly responded and rounded up all the suspects.  Members also managed to seize a number of boxes at various places in East London including at the local police quarters,” said Mulaudzi.
All six suspects have appeared in the East London Magistrates’ Court on Thursday facing charges of corruption and theft.
Constables Azola Ndongeni (33), Mkolisi Matthews Gola (38), Luthando Klaas (34), Siyabonga Freddie (36), Siseko Dayimani (33) and taxi driver, Xolani Valantiya (43) were granted R1 000 bail each pending their next appearance on 20 September, the Hawks said.
