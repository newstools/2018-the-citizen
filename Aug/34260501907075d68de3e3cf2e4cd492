A car wash employee managed to cause a car crash in Walvis Bay, Namibia with what some on social media are calling the worst driving ever.
The employee, driving a customer’s Toyota Fortuner, was just trying to move the car from the drying station to the polishing station, according to Jacaranda News.
Instead, the hapless car washer swerved into traffic, losing control of the car and crashing into two vehicles at an intersection, damaging at least one other car in the process, as well as causing significant damage to the Fortuner itself.


People on Facebook, where the clip posted by Namib Times has garnered almost fifty thousand views, have questioned whether the employee had a valid driver’s license and have called for both the owner of the business and the employee, who may have experienced the worst day at work of his career, to face disciplinary action.
