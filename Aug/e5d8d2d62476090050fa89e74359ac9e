His daughter, Amanda Hanekom, said he was chased by unknown suspects down the road. “He ran to the Marula Hotel for safety. Four men with Balaclavas drove through the security gate of the hotel and confronted Andre.”
Witnesses reported Andre was shot at several times and seriously wounded. “They threw him in the back of a brown Toyota Cruiser, and they disappeared with him. We have no idea if he has been treated or how serious his condition is.”
His wife, Francis Hanekom, told Lowvelder on Friday she had news that a man fitting her husband’s description was in a hospital in another town close to Palma. “I am getting in my car now. We are praying it is him. I will inform everyone as soon as I know.”
She had stated on her Facebook page that the first news she received was from a gate guard running into her home telling her, that her husband had been shot and killed. “My heart and whole world stopped. Please appreciate the people in your life. I was lucky, because Andre is still alive and kicking.”
She said Andre was supposed to go to the bank that day to pay his taxes and come straight back home.
“He did not come back, but instead a dreaded ‘missing person’ situation was showing its unwelcome, cold, grinning face in my world.”
She also stressed the kidnapping was not related to terrorism.
“Andre was chased by men with balaclavas over their faces, a civilian vehicle with ‘Safari’ written on the side, without number plates. I make the assumption that he fled to the hotel, as they are the only business in Palma whom have 24 hour armed guards on duty. According to eye witnesses, Andre opened the gate, which is always closed and opened by the guards. When they closed it after his entrance, the abductors’ vehicle came around the corner and bashed open the gate with their vehicle.”
She said the manager of the hotel was by chance on the spot at that specific moment. “As he started to talk to them, they fired shots in the air.”
The men had three AK 47’s and firearm. “Andre was shot in the left arm, grabbed and thrown in the back of their brown Land Cruiser. They fled driving towards the city centre.”
