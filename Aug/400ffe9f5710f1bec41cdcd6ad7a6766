Democratic Alliance shadow minister of energy Gavin Davis on Tuesday said government had no plan of stopping the ever-increasing fuel price.
Davis was reacting to Energy Minister Jeff Radebe and his department’s failure to pitch for a meeting with MPs about fuel hikes.
“Minister Radebe and the energy department’s failure to turn up at an energy portfolio committee meeting on the petrol price is the clearest indication yet that government has no plan to deal with escalating fuel costs.
“This no-show by a government delegation was disrespectful to parliament and, more importantly, disrespectful to the millions of South Africans who are struggling with the high cost of living,” he said.
Davis said Radebe was supposed to communicate on the petrol price in the second week of July, but he had said nothing.
“This was his opportunity to offer South Africans hope that government had a plan to cushion the blow of high fuel costs. The minister has an opportunity to prove us wrong by appearing before the committee next Tuesday and presenting a credible plan to bring down the price of petrol,” he said.
Earlier on Tuesday, chairperson of the portfolio committee on energy Fikile Majola also slammed Radebe’s department for what he described as a “boycott” of the meeting.
Majola said the minister would be summoned to parliament next week to explain the department’s failure to attend the meeting.
Petrol price has increased from R13.76 in March to R16.02 in July.
