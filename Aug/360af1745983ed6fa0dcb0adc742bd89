Gauteng Economic Freedom Fighters were protesting outside accused racist Adam Catzavelos house on Friday demanding he come outside to talk.
In a video apparently taken outside Catzavelos’ home, the EFF members can be seen using the K-word in an attempt to urge Adam to come out.
“Don’t waste our time, we just want to talk,” says one of the protesters adding that the streets were blocked.
It is not confirmed if Adam is back in the country.


This latest development comes after an apology letter, confirmed to have been issued by Adam, surfaced on social media on Friday. In the letter, he admitted to causing unspeakable pain to people in South Africa.
“The extensive damage my unfortunate video has caused to a country desperately trying to heal racial tensions is unacceptable.”
He continues to profess his love for South Africa and that he was proud “to have lived in such a beautiful and diverse country.”
He apologises for the hurt and harm caused.

Social media, however, does not believe his apology to be sincere.
