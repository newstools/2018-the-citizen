South Africans have been sharing messages through Thursday wishing Sbahle Mpisane well after she was injured in a car crash in the early hours of Thursday morning.
She is still in a Durban hospital, in ICU, after being involved in a horrific crash on Victoria Embankment.
She was critically injured when her car left the road, hit a pole and overturned. There has also been speculation that another passenger in the car may have been fatally injured, based on pictures of the scene that have been shared. According to some reports the unfortunate fatality was her friend Xolo.

All you of those who are saying they won't #PrayForSbahle because she blocked you. Please go get a life outside of Twitter, and fix your heart. Sies
