The annual event has been taking place for the past five years and helps to highlight the plight of the Roodepoort SPCA, which services a large area on little resources.
The organisation has been struggling to care for more than 250 dogs and 150 cats on a monthly basis. These are animals in their care because they have been abandoned, dumped, not claimed by their owners or confiscated.
The organisation’s manager and senior inspector, Mandy Cattanach, said they had more than 30 confiscated dogs in their care.
“These dogs need special love, food and care. They will be in our care for many, many more months,” added Cattanach.
The community is encouraged to bring a bag of dog or cat food to the event and be given a free shooter. Some of the bands slated to perform include No Regret, Burning Blue, The Vast Oddity and Up Your Sleeve.
