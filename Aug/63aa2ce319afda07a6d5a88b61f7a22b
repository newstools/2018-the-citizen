The South African currency plummeted to a six-week low and government bonds weakened amid global trade tensions and slides in the Russian ruble and Turkish lira, which combined to dampen global market enthusiasm towards emerging market assets.
The US-China trade spat has had a negative impact on global growth, leaving the rand and other emerging market currencies on the back foot.
Turkey’s lira and the Russian rouble were the hit hardest, according to analysts, with the lira hitting a new record low against the US dollar on Friday.
Turkey sent a delegation to Washington to discuss the trade crisis, but returned with no clear solution, sparking concerns of a widening rift between the nation and the US.
Meanwhile, Washington’s decision to impose new sanctions on Moscow led to the ruble sliding to a two-year low.
Early on Friday morning, the rand was trading at 13.8125 per dollar, 0.86 percent weaker than its close on Thursday.
Earlier in the session, the rand lost nearly 2 percent to 13.9500, it weakest since June 28, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
