A couple lying on loungers beside a pool at a private lodge in the Kruger National Park did not dare to move when three elephants suddenly joined them at the pool.
But the giant beasts were intent on quenching their thirst, and didn’t pay much attention to their human company.
The incident was filmed by another couple who were about to sunbathe on the deck, when the elephants emerged.
