Eastern Cape dam levels remain stable but dam levels in Nelson Mandela Bay are becoming a concern, the Department of Water and Sanitation has said.
Department spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said the Algoa Water Supply System, supplying water to Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and surrounding areas, is on a consistent decline and at the beginning of this week sat at a low 18.1%.
Ratau said that this was a massive decline as compared to 32% last year during the same period.
Meanwhile, provincial water storage in the Eastern Cape was stable, with the average at 62.2%. The Amathole Water Supply System, supplying water to the Buffalo City area has shown a consistent improvement in recent months and is sitting at 89.5%, while the Gcuwa Dam at Butterworth was at 100% of capacity.
Nelson Mandela Bay enjoyed good recent rainfall, with the South African Weather Service on Wednesday measuring 16.4 millimetres at the Port Elizabeth International Airport. However, not a drop was measured at Patensie and the Kouga Dam, which is now critical at less than 7% of capacity.
