The weapons were seized on Sunday at the Port of Ngqura when the Russian ship was offloading containers which had the right permits, according to the newspaper.
On board the ship, 20 other allegedly illegal containers were found. The publication reports that a tip-off led to the bust which followed an investigation by the Port Elizabeth Explosives Unit.
