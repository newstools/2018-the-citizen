Maya Angelou’s poem ”Still I Rise” could have easily been written to describe the life of anti-apartheid struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Saturday.
He read out the poem to thousands of mourners gathered for the funeral at Orlando Stadium in Soweto before describing Madikizela-Mandela’s resilience at the height of the apartheid regime, decrying her pain as she held the fort when her former husband Nelson Mandela and other African National Congress leaders were in prison and some in exile.
”They sought to denigrate her with bitter and twisted lies, but still she rose. They wanted to see her broken, with bowed head and lowered eyes, and weakened by soulful cries, but still she rose,” he said as he delivered the eulogy.
Her own party, the ANC, was not there for her when she rose during those tumultuous times, he said.
”As we bid her farewell, we are forced to admit that too often as she rose, she rose alone. The day after she died, the ANC’s top six leaders went to her home to pay our condolences to her family. [Eldest daughter] Zenani Mandela, reflecting on her mother’s life and overcome by emotion, said ‘My mother suffered. She had a very difficult life’. Then she burst into tears. ‘That statement and those tears have stayed with me since that day,” Ramaphosa said.
Madikizela-Mandela had been left to tend to her own pain alone.
”Left alone to fend for herself only caused her more pain. But she touched our wounds all the time. When we lost our loved ones, when people were in pain, overcome with anger, prone to violence, she came to touch our wounds. She bore witness to our suffering. She bandaged our wounds … we did not do the same for her,” Ramaphosa said.
