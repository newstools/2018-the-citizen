Parliament has highlighted the urgent need to strengthen its mandate against corruption to advance cohesion in the country.
The Speakers Forum meeting, led by National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete, also called for the legislative sector to play a leading role in fighting corruption.
Strengthening the regulatory framework on ethics for public representatives was emphasised to combat corruption, parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said yesterday.
To achieve this, the forum noted that it needed to assess the existing mechanisms and make amendments to them where necessary. Due to inadequate funding, the forum also called for a budget for the legislative sector.
“There may be a need for legislative intervention on this, that will be explored and the relevant legislative process will be followed,” Mothapo said. The forum also discussed the progress made on implementing a high-level panel’s recommendation for a focus on key problems affecting each province.
Parliament has since established a subcommittee, cochaired by the house chairpersons for committees. The subcommittee’s task is to ensure that the panel’s recommendations receive consideration in parliament.
“The provincial legislatures will attend to province-specific matters needing immediate attention,” Mothapo said. To achieve the goal of a strengthened mandate, the forum would compile a legacy report to highlight issues that need attention.
“This will serve as an invaluable resource for the Speakers Forum and the legislative sector as a whole during parliamentary sittings,” said Mothapo.
