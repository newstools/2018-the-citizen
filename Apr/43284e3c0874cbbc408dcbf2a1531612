South African Police Service (SAPS) detectives attached to the Humewood police station in Port Elizabeth are urgently trying to find a 48-year-old man from Gabon who went missing during the early hours of Friday morning, Eastern Cape police said.
According to police information, David Rene Roger Bellet-Brissaud and his wife booked into the Paxton Hotel in Port Elizabeth at about 3.20pm on Thursday, Colonel Priscilla Naidu said.
“He was in Port Elizabeth to participate in the Iron Man Africa Championship. After settling in, the couple took a walk on the beachfront and later dined with friends (other participants from Gabon) at the Boardwalk complex,” she said.
At about 9pm, they retired to their rooms. It was further alleged that at about 1am on Friday, his wife woke up and noticed that her husband was not in the room and had been missing ever since.
CCTV footage showed that Bellet-Brissaud left the room and walked out of the hotel and down the street. It was not clear in which direction he walked once he reached the main road.
He did not take his wallet or cellphone with him. He was wearing a black hoodie top with the word “Adidas” on the sleeves, blue jeans, and takkies. “He wears prescription glasses and sports a beard. His hair is slightly long. He does not speak fluent English. It is the first time that the couple is visiting Port Elizabeth and this would have been his first race. He is not familiar with the place,” Naidu said.
Police appealed to anyone who may have seen Bellet-Brissaud or who could provide any information on his whereabouts to contact Detective Warrant Officer Eric Mathews at SAPS Humewood on 083-380-3714, or Crime Stop 08600-10111, or SAPS Humewood on 041-504-019.
