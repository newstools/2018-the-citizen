The driver, who preferred to remain anonymous, contacted the Zululand Observer in a state of shock and said he could not believe what he had seen.

“I was driving and all of a sudden I had to slam on brakes because a leopard dashed across the road and ran straight into the sugarcane.
“I am certain it was a leopard, you could see the spots and the build of the animal,” he said.
Meanwhile, members of KZN Ezemvelo Wildlife combed the area at the bridge, near Owen Sithole College on Friday afternoon, in an attempt to identify any spoor left behind by the animal.
