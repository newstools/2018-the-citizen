Some, particularly ANC supporters, were critical of a tribute to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela that was screened at the DA’s federal congress on Saturday.
While some thought the tribute was “moving”, others such as political commentator Pieter Howes said it was “twisted, convoluted white sorcery”.


Howes claimed that: “Just days ago DA members were out in full force demonizing Mam’ Winnie with lies and smears of the worst kind. Now they are cheering her legacy at the #DAcongress2018. It’s twisted, convoluted white sorcery.”
Howes’ view generated much comment, with one user comparing Madikizela-Mandela to Hitler.


Another user said the party was merely trying to cash in on the death of the struggle icon to get votes.


Others, however, felt the DA was doing the right thing.


It’s not the first time the opposition party has faced criticism when it comes to the Mandela name.
In 2016, in the lead-up to the municipal elections, DA leader Mmusi Maimane urged Soweto residents not to feel obliged to vote for the ANC, as it was no longer the party Nelson Mandela had fought for.
At the Dobsonville Stadium, he claimed: “We’re the only party that is carrying forward the vision and the values of Nelson Mandela.”
Maimane said he too had voted for the ANC things had changed under the then president, Jacob Zuma, and the party no longer carried forward the values of Mandela.
The ANC also took particular exception to the DA using Mandela in its election materials.
The party has been trying to make a commitment to diversity a key feature of its policies, though it rejected the need for quotas on Saturday.
