“We have noted the concerning threats by Olievenhoutbosch residents that they will not vacate the illegally occupied houses meant for the Mooiplaats community,” Tshwane mayoral spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi said.
This after City mayor Solly Msimanga and Gauteng premier David Makhura visited the area last week.
Their visit was meant to give the community feedback about the planned relocation and service delivery issues in the area.
The City had planned to move residents in the Mooiplaats informal settlement to RDP houses, as the area was not fully habitable.
“The relocation of Mooiplaats residents is necessary as the area is dolomitic and only a fraction of the land is habitable,” Mgobozi said.
“We have continuously met with communities of both Olievenhoutbosch and Mooiplaats to address concerns over RDP allocation before distribution commences.”
He said the city would continue to engage with residents, and emphasised that law and order should be adhered to.
