A beaming President Cyril Ramaphosa was given an unofficial inauguration and welcome aboard a flight from Durban to Johannesburg earlier this week, much to the delight of fellow passengers.
Comair honoured the president by sending first-time flyer and praise poet Lutendo Evans Mugagadeli, known as “Vendaboy Poet”, to give him a warm welcome on board.
Bridgette Ramuluvhana, marketing manager for BA-Comair, said Mugagadeli recently said in an interview that he’d be honoured to meet the president and act as his official praise poet.
“We were delighted to make that happen in true British Airways – operated by Comair – style, and to ensure Mr Ramaphosa had a presidential welcome aboard. It exemplifies the British Airways brand promise, ‘To Fly. To serve,’” she said.
