A security guard from the Sandton Sky apartments has disputed seeing Karabo Mokoena lying on the floor with pills scattered around.
During proceedings at the South Gauteng High Court on Wednesday, guard Isaac Mabasa told the court that when he opened Sandile Mantsoe’s apartment he did not see Mokoena on the floor with pills.
A year ago Mokoena was found murdered in a ditch, allegedly at the hands of of ex-boyfriend Mantsoe. Her body had been doused with petrol, a tyre placed around her, and then set alight.
State prosecutor Mike Hlatswayo called Constable Pule Khotelo to the stand, who told the court that he went to the Sky apartments to look for an entry in the occurrence book after he saw a statement made by Mantsoe that said he asked the security guards to open for him because he had left his key inside.
“I only found one entry for 29 April 2017,” Khotelo said.
Khotelo said in the statement by Mantsoe he had stated that when the security opened the apartment, they found Mokoena on the floor with pills surrounding her.
Earlier, Malerato Ramela, the doctor who did the autopsy on Mokoena’s body, said due to the absence of a large part of the body she could not determine whether Mokoena was alive or dead when she was burnt.
The matter was postponed to Thursday.
