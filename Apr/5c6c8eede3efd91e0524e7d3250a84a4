We don’t know who plans these things, but South Africa was agog on Saturday morning at the sight of EFF leader Julius Malema being seated next to ANC Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini at Orlando Stadium for the funeral service of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.
He was already looking glum due to the sombre nature of proceedings, and sat looking even more unhappy as Dlamini sang.
He recently viciously insulted Dlamini by referring to her as the “Drunkard of the Nation” in contrast to Madikizela-Mandela having been the Mother of the Nation.

“Nkosazana Zuma will never be Mother of the Nation. Bathabile Dlamini … maybe her title will be Drunkard of the Nation.”
Dlamini always takes huge exception to any suggestion that she touches alcohol.
Malema was due to speak at the funeral later.


Twitter seemed to think that whoever the person was who had arranged the seating arrangements, it was well played.
