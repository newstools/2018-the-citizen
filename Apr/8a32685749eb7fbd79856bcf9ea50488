The EFF’s motion for a vote of no confidence in Nelson Mandela Bay executive mayor Athol Trollip will be debated in a special council meeting on Tuesday.
This was announced today following the spectacular collapse of highly charged council proceedings last week in which the motion was supposed to be heard.
Council speaker Jonathan Lawack is hoping that next week’s meeting would be more fruitful, as last week’s sitting never really got off the ground due to objections, walk-outs and shouting matches.
“I sincerely hope that common sense will prevail and that we will argue whatever we wanted to argue, for or against, and that we will come to a conclusion on this,” Lawack said.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) has accused the opposition of deliberately disrupting last week’s council meeting, saying the motion against Trollip was bound to fail.
The motion came as the DA didn’t back an Economic Freedom Fighters-sponsored motion to review the Constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation.
The red berets are now going after mayor Trollip to punish the DA.
Trollip, however, is confident he will walk the vote.
“We were ready to debate that item at 8am [last week]. We had the numbers on our sides, we [still] have the numbers on our sides,” he told eNCA.
“The EFF has six councillors in a council of 120 councillors…they are too big for their boots and won’t get this motion right even with the ANC. We will continue in government until the end of our term….the EFF will battle to get the numbers. We’ve got the numbers and we’re going to try firm them up even more.”
