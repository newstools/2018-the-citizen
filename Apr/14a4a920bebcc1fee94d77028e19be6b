High levels of unemployment are a major obstacle to achieving the goals set in South Africa’s National Development Plan and the answer lies in harnessing young people’s entrepreneurial spirit, the spokesperson for an entrepreneurship competition co-sponsored by Sanlam said on Thursday.
The NDP, which the government launched in 2012, is a detailed blueprint for how the country can eliminate poverty and reduce inequality by 2030, but critics says this will not be achieved while economic growth remains lacklustre, keeping unemployment high at around 27 percent of the labour force.
“Raising employment levels and expanding the tax base so that there are enough taxpayers and contributors to ensure the sustainability of social protection is imperative for reaching NDP goals,” said the spokeswoman for the 2018 Entrepreneur of the Year® competition, Gugu Mjadu.
“Current and future entrepreneurs need to be nurtured and supported as they are critical for building a strong, dynamic SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) sector and creating much-needed jobs. Both government and business have a key role to play in making this a reality.”
