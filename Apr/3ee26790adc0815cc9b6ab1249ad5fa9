The result ensures that South Africa will advance to the next round tomorrow.
The were level pegging at 12-all at the break after each side managed two tries each in the opening stanza. Siviwe Soyizwapi and Werner Kok dotted down for the Boks.
For Argentina, Tomas Passaro and Lautaro Velez scored tries.
In the second half, Argentina had no answer to the pace of Selvyn Davids and Muller du Plessis who produced the tries (both converted) to put the match eventually beyond the opposition.
In their earlier match against Canada, the hero was Selvyn Davids, who scored a brace.
The Blitzboks had to fight hard for their victory, using their speed and class against a physical Canadian side.
South Africa were under the whip early in the game after Andrew Coe scored the first try.
But moments later, the Blitzboks tapped a free-kick on the halfway line and Zain Davids went on a run. Once the cover defence moved in he slipped the ball wide to Siviwe Soyizwapi, who finished off in the corner.
It was then the turn of Cecil Africa who was next in when he made a dash for the line to give his side the lead at halftime.
South Africa took their foot off the pedal after the restart and allowed Canada to hit back through speedster Tevaughn Campbell who finished in the right corner to make it a two-point game.
But the Blitzboks held their nerve under pressure. The tricky Davids scored two breakaway tries late in the game to seal the victory which sent South Africa at the top of pool standings after earlier despatching Samoa. â€“ African News Agency (ANA)
