The Youth Chamber of Commerce & Industries South Africa has threatened to take government entities in Mpumalanga that have failed to comply with policies meant to promote the economic empowerment of black people to court.
In a statement late on Wednesday, YCCSA said municipalities, government departments and state firms in the province were reluctant to implement the provisions of the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (PPPFA), which are meant to help create jobs for young South Africans.
The act stipulates that 30 percent of tenders and other related jobs must be given to local youth and black women, who were the most disadvantaged during decades of the country’s apartheid system, which favoured white people.
“As an organisation responsible for creating jobs for the youth, we feel that the public sector’s failure to implement these laws becomes an obstacle for us to create jobs for young people,” YCCSA acting national president Victor Mashego said.
His organisation planned to take noncompliant entities to court, he added.
