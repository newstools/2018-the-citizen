Origin of terrorists
Countries of origin are Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Face of Sipah-e-Sahaba
The main actor for Sipah-e-Sahaba in South Africa is Obaid Ubaidullah. A copy of his ID accompanies this report. He obtained this SA identity fraudulently.
Main activities
• The Bangladeshis are also used to raise funds for the Sipah-e-Sahaba organisation and the Pakistanis promise them a form of protection from ordinary criminals, but that protection does not happen.
• Obaid established a madrassa and a school. He recruits children from squatter camps and Soweto and converts them to Islam and teaches them to revere Pakistan and Islam and to hate all other countries.
Level of infiltration
Very deeply embedded in various political and social formations throughout the country.
Areas of infiltration
Political, social, business, residential, local government, provincial government and national government.
Terrorist activities in South Africa
• Fund-raising
• Bank fraud
• Money laundering
• Hijacking trucks especially those transporting food and electronic goods – using Zimbabweans and Mozambique criminals
• Human trafficking and human smuggling using closed “bread-transportation vehicles”
• Recruiting and converting children to Islam and then when they reach the age of 16 they are sent to Pakistan to receive military training
• Coordinating fund-raising for Kashmiri groups
• Coordinating fund-raising for Pakistan South Africa Associations
• Infiltrating and coordinating the Muslim community in South Africa who are the prime funders outside of their criminal activities.
Danger posed to India
Short term: Enter SA by whatever means necessary and obtain South African identity documents, using whatever means, and obtaining South African passports.
Medium term: Train such children in terrorist activities so they can be deployed anywhere in the world with India as their main target.
Long term: Have a full supply of South Africans as members of Sipah-e-Sahaba, and to deploy them wherever he wishes to, as well as being able to turn India into an Islamic state while continuing to use South Africa as an fund-raising and operational base until they can turn South Africa into an Islamic State as well.
India is the main target of these Sipah-e-Sabha terrorist activities. Countries targeted include, but are not limited to, Israel, USA, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Australia, Switzerland, South Korea and Canada.
Money laundered to: 
• South Africa has been very relaxed, hence the alleged money laundering and fund-raising have been going on for approximately 15 to 20 years
• Some rand are converted into US dollars in South Africa
• Pakistan is the main destination of all money that is laundered
• Money is converted into dollars in South Africa, particularly in the Fordsburg area, and then taken by road to Mozambique, and from there to Tanzania and to Pakistan
• Other Pakistani money launderers, like one male named Bilal who lives and operates in Fordsburg 8th Street, is one of the main Pakistani money launderers who has also infiltrated the police in Gauteng.
Background of Pakistani nationals in South Africa
Many Pakistani nationals are living in South Africa. Some are legally in South Africa, but the majority are living illegally in the country. Their presence in South Africa can be traced back to 1994.
Infiltration and invasion of government departments
Certain Pakistani crime syndicates and other so-called non-profit organisations that operate in South Africa have a very specific modus operandi.
This modus operandi has been refined since 1994, when fully functional crime syndicates began to enter South Africa. Government departments that they have allegedly targeted to embed themselves and control specific officials include, but are not limited to: The Department of Home Affairs, Department of Health, Department of Human Settlements, Department of Housing at Local Government, SAPS, Crime Intelligence, Directorate of Priority Crime Investigations (known as the Hawks), Metropolitan Police in Johannesburg, Metropolitan Police in Tshwane, Metropolitan Police in Ethekwini and the State Security Agency.
Purpose of the infiltration
These Pakistani syndicates operate on the basis of them ultimately taking over South Africa, and using it as a base from which to make the whole of Africa an Islamic continent.
Comment 
• The infiltration process is accompanied by a bribe of money and invitations to Pakistani or Bangladeshi owned restaurants.
• The main factor that enables infiltration of government departments is the monetary aspect.
• In South Africa, it is an unfortunate reality that many government officials are easily bribed for sums of money that can vary from R5 000 to millions of rand, depending on what is desired by the person that offers the bribe.
• Pakistani nationals have an embedded network that they use to bribe officials from immigration officials to generals in the police.
