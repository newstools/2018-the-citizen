Thabiso Mkhonto (25) stabbed his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter more than 24 times, vowing to kill her.
The victim, Mpho Chuma, later said: “At some point, I couldn’t cry or scream, I just lay there – I just felt the knife going in and out.”

The 23-year-old Chuma claimed Mkhonto lured her to his house under false pretenses.
“He asked me to come over so we could go see a psychologist the next morning.”
She had earlier insisted on him seeking psychological help before she would consider the rekindling of their romance.
“I knew he had anger issues because he had a lot of outbursts,” Chuma said.
Chuma escaped with multiple stab wounds to her lungs, face and other parts of her body.
