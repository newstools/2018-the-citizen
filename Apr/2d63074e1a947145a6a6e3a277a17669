Four suspects were arrested and charged with possession of unlicensed firearms, ammunition, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and attempted murder.
“The suspects were arrested for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, a stolen motel motor vehicle and attempted murder,” added Subramoney. “The suspects were aged between 38 and 52 years old and will soon be appearing in the Randburg Magistrates’ Court.
“Community members should always work together with the police by providing information of criminal activities in their areas, and not hide criminals but expose them.”
