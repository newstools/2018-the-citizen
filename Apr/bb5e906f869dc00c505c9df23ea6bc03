The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has said that its deputy president, Floyd Shivambu, will attend the official memorial service for Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in Johannesburg on Wednesday.
The EFF said that Shivambu would lead the party delegation inclusive of its Gauteng provincial and regional command teams.
Shivambu on Monday also addressed a memorial service organised by his party for Madikizela-Mandela in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni.
EFF leader Julius Malema will address the memorial in Brandfort, the small Free State town where Madikizela-Mandela was banished in 1977.
An official memorial will be held for the Mother of the Nation, as Madikizela-Mandela was affectionately known, at Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Wednesday morning.
Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department has warned that traffic will be restricted along roads leading to the Stadium.
Madikizela-Mandela died on Easter Monday at a Johannesburg hospital. She was 81.
