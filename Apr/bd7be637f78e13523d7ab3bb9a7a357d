A video has emerged of a group of men who tried to hijack a couple in Van Dyk Park, Boksburg Advertiser reports.
In the video, the owner of the nearly hijacked vehicle smashed into their getaway vehicle.
It appears as if the couple were about to leave their driveway in Van Dyk Park, Boksburg, on Thursday night last week, when they were accosted by armed men and forced out of their vehicle.
The suspects could not reverse the car and ran back to their getaway car. This is when the male victim jumped back into the car and reversed into the suspects’ car.



In the video, it is the clear the suspects left the house and headed towards a white getaway car parked on the other side of the road.
Suddenly, the almost hijacked car reverses at speed down the driveway and smashes into their vehicle.
The Advertiser is following up in the story, but reports suggest that the two suspects were apprehended by the community and handed to the police.
