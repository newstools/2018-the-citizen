Two people were killed and another was critically injured when a minibus taxi crashed into a tree on Main Reef Road in Maraisburg, Johannesburg on Sunday evening, paramedics said.
ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene at 7.15pm to find a minibus taxi smashed against a large tree. Three people were found lying inside the vehicle, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said.
“Upon closer inspection, paramedics found the driver lying trapped in a critical condition. Two other patients, a man and woman, were found lying trapped and motionless. Unfortunately, the two patients had already succumbed to their injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead.”
Fire services had to use specialised equipment to free the critically injured driver. Once freed, paramedics treated the man and provided him with advanced life support interventions before he was transported to to a nearby provincial hospital for urgent care, Meiring said.
