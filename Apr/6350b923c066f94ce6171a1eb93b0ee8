An internal motion of no confidence against Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille was passed during a special Democratic Alliance (DA) Cape Town caucus meeting.
This paves the way for her to be recalled by her party, News24 reports.
The motion was put on the table following the DA’s approval of a so-called “recall clause” at its federal congress earlier in April.

De Lille said before the meeting that she would be challenging the constitutionality of the clause in court.

 
She also wants to determine if it can be applied “retrospectively” to her, given that she had a pending disciplinary process in the party.
Now that the motion has succeeded, De Lille will not be automatically removed as mayor.
The process will be referred back to the DA’s federal executive, which will then ask De Lille to make representations to defend herself, as per the party’s new recall clause.
If the federal executive ratifies the caucus’ decision, she will be given 48 hours to resign. Failing that, her membership of the party will be terminated.
