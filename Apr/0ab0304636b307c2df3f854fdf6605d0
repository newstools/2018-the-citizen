The National Prosecuting Authority has announced that it will prosecute former president Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane Zuma, for culpable homicide.
He was given a two-month deadline to make representations on why he should not be prosecuted.
The NPA’s decision comes after Zuma missed an earlier deadline of end March 2018 to make representations on why he should not be prosecuted.
This deadline followed Afriforum’s advocate Gerrie Nel applying for a certificate of nonprosecution from the NPA in October last year, to enable him to privately prosecute Zuma on behalf of the Dube family.
The matter relates to a crash on February 1, 2014 when Zuma’s Porsche rear-ended a minibus taxi on the M1 South off-ramp to Grayston Drive in Sandton.
Taxi passenger Phumzile Dube was killed and three others were injured.
Zuma said he lost control of his Porsche after it hit a puddle in rainy conditions.
An inquest in the Randburg Magistrates’ Court in November 2014 found Zuma should be held criminally liable for the accident as he did not lower his speed in the wet conditions, and his negligence had caused Dube’s death.
However, the NPA decided on August 18, 2015 to not prosecute the younger Zuma.
