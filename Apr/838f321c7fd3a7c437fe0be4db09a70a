Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip was re-elected as DA federal council chairperson on Sunday afternoon after a spirited campaign by Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga.
The position was also being contested by DA Free State chairperson Annelie Lotriet.
More than 1700 delegates at the Democratic Alliance’s federal congress at the Tshwane Events Centre in Pretoria had concluded voting for new leadership on Sunday morning.
Two positions – that of party leader Mmusi Maimane and federal executive chairman James Selfe – were not contested during the federal congress.
The newly elected leadership will lead the party to the national and provincial elections next year.
Other leaders were elected to the DA’s top structures, including youth leaders and a number of deputies, on Saturday.
Michael Waters, Ivan Mayor and Refilwe Ntsekhe were elected the three deputy chairpersons, while Dion George was elected as the federal finance chair.
The elections saw the close of the conference with an address by Maimane saying he looked forward to working with all of those who’d been elected to drive the party’s updated plans.

Earlier, a proposed amendment to the party’s constitution to allow for a deputy leader was rejected.
Prominent DA MP Natasha was one of those who were standing for the position were it approved.
Other proposed amendments to the constitution also fared badly this weekend, with a change to put in place quotas for racial transformation in the party also rejected on Saturday.
A move to increase branch representation from 35% to 45% was, however, accepted by the congress on Sunday morning.
