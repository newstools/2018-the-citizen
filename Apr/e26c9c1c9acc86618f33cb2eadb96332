The massive strike action prompted mixed reactions on twitter, with many nervous at the thought of a gridlock of protesters expected to arrive at city centers tmorrow morning.
The federation says the proposed minimum wage of R20 per hour or R3 500 a month is too low and reassured patrons that the strike will be peaceful.
Tweeps had a lot to say about the expected national strike.








A message circulated on social media saying those not participating in the strike should rather stay indoors.  The message was reported to be fake.




Some questioned the strikes purpose.


A map indicating the different assembly points also circulated.


Others hoped the day was on Thursday eyeing the looming extended weekend.




While others had sinister intentions.
