Part of what appeaeds to be a house in Beaumont Road, Ocean View on the Bluff in Durban collapsed on Tuesday afternoon, reports Southlands Sun.
At about 1.15pm, Rescue Care paramedics and fire department officials responded to the scene, where they found two workers had been injured.
One man was still entrapped by the rubble and sand that gave way. Fire department officials were trying to free the man while advanced life support paramedics worked to stabilise him. Another worker sustained minor injuries and was treated at the scene.
From photos taken at the scene, it appeared a retaining wall collapsed, taking with it part of a structure. Walls of what appeared to be a house sheared off and could be seen lying down an embankment. Police were also at the scene to investigate.
