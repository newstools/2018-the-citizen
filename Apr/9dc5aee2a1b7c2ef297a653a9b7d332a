The Kudu bull spotted by Middelburg resident Gordon Venters this morning is in the process of being released back into the wild, Middelburg Observer reports.
Dr Tobie Spies, a vet from Central Vet, tranquilised the Kudu before they made their way to the Loskop Nature Reserve, where the young bull will be released.
The Kudu broke his jaw when he leaped from the HTS auditorium.
