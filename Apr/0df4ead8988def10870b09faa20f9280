The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is taking the battle against the Guptas to Dubai.
Officials have asked the United Arab Emirates government to preserve R169 million the family allegedly stole and transferred out of South Africa, according to media reports on Sunday.
City Press reported that a senior prosecutor working close to the case told the newspaper the NPA was confident that authorities in Dubai would co-operate.
This was the first official step local law enforcement authorities had taken to pursue the Guptas, close friends of former president Jacob Zuma, to Dubai where they own a mansion that allegedly cost them R331 million, City Press reported.
