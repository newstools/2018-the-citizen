Former president Jacob Zuma was warmly welcomed by a large crowd attending a Winnie Madikizela-Mandela memorial event at a packed marquee in Durban on Thursday.
On his 76th birthday, the crowd sang happy birthday to him after singing: ““Wenzeni uZuma awuphendule” and repeatedly chanting his name.
He remains enormously popular in KwaZulu-Natal, his home province. Deputy President David Mabuza was reportedly meant to attend the event.
