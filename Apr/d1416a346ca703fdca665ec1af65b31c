ANC Womens League President Bathabile Dlamini paid tribute to the struggle stalwart and remembered her as a liberation fighter. “She was the fighter of our people. She walked right in the steps of our late [ANC] president Oliver Tambo.”
Dlamini reminisced about Madikizela-Mandela’s struggle. “We know there have been times where we have felt weak. But Mama Winnie came and became the president of the Women’s League,” said Dlamini.
She added that women were always inquisitive to know more about the stalwart and always desired to follow in her footsteps.
“Mam’ Winnie was an uncompromising freedom fighter, and was a firebrand.”
Dlamini highlighted Madikizela-Mandela’s will to fight for women’s right, despite her battles being ignored. “It’s only a lioness that can behave like you and protect everyone. Patriarchy has secluded and sideline Mam’ Winnie.
“Today women do not have their own history and struggle credentials.”
In honour of the struggle stalwart, Dlamini concluded by requesting for women to have “Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Day”.
