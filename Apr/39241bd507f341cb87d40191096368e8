The nation is in mourning as we lay to rest Nomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela-Mandela in a final farewell.
Early on Saturday, the same hearse that carried her late former husband, Nelson Mandela, bore her coffin to Orlando Stadium, where mourners from around South Africa and the world have gathered to offer their last respects.
