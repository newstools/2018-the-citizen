President Cyril Ramaphosa, who flew in from the UK last night to rush to Mahikeng to quell the violent protests amid calls for North West premier Supra Mahumapelo to step down, has arrived where the ANC is meeting in the province’s capital to address the unrest.
An unverified Twitter account described in its bio as the “official ANC North West Province Twitter profile,” dismissed allegations that Mahumapelo was refusing to meet with the state and party president.


The government has condemned the protests, urging residents and all stakeholders to enter into talks in order to find a peaceful solution.
The protesting residents, however, are demanding that Ramaphosa remove Mahumapelo.
Mahikeng has been shut down amid widespread looting and public violence since Wednesday, as calls for Mahumapelo to resign intensify.
