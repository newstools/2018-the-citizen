Spokesperson Lerato Moleko said PhilaNdoda was an initiative of the Academy for Quality Healthcare (AQuaH), a national company based in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga.
“We offer free Circumcision, HIV test and blood pressure checkup. Circumcision starts from 10 years upwards. If the child is under 18 years, the parent/guardian must accompany the child with copy of ID for consent and the child’s birth certificate,” said Moleko, adding AQuaH was a quality-improvement organisation advocating for patient-safety in healthcare.
“Some of our projects include HIV counselling and testing services, training, coaching and the provision of Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision. VMMC is a vital HIV prevention strategy that aims to reduce the risk of HIV infection from women to men by 60 percent.”
Dr Lesego Mawela, founder and director of AQuaH with over 10 years of experience in healthcare, said he believed voluntary medical male circumcision was an entry point that would increase the number of men who access this healthcare service.
“The programme will create a platform to engage men about pressing social issues, health education and allow men to take leadership in preventing the negative impact due to HIV/AIDS and TB.”
