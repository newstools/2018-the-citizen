“Drugs confiscated included 5g heroin, 67g tik (methampethamine), 8702 Mandrax tablets and 268g  dagga.”
Officers arrested 53 wanted suspects and recovered three illegal firearms.
“Five stolen vehicles were recovered and a total of 197 vehicle check points were held throughout the cluster,” van Wyk said.
“Five arrests were executed for the possession of dangerous weapons and 16 suspects were arrested for the possession of possibly stolen goods.”
