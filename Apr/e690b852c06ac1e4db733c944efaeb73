Although jumping from a wide draw, the Alan Greeff-trained Fire In The Belly should be up to the task again when stepping out with Charles Ndlovu aboard at the Fairview Polytrack in Race 7, and Leg 2 of the WSB East Cape Poly Challenge over 1400m.
This former Western Cape four-year-old has not been out of the money on the Polytrack in six starts since joining Greeff’s stable. Three of those runs were resounding wins over 1600m – the last of which saw him carry 57.5kg to victory by an increasing 3.75 lengths from Prince Of Orange in a MR 85 Handicap. The four-year-old will carry 2kg more this time but that should not stop him from landing his fifth career win.
Another bold bid can be expected from Gavin Smith-trained Prince Of Orange (Warren Kennedy) who took a liking to the Polytrack last time after two runs on turf at Fairview. The former Gauteng-based six-year-old deserves the utmost respect with the extra 2kg he will be receiving from Fire In The Belly.
Also in with claims is Greeff-trained four-time winner Breakfast Club (Greg Cheyne) who will be out on a retrieving mission after going off favourite in his last two outings at the Polytrack, where he finished fourth and then a 0.75-length second under 61.5kg in a 1600m MR 80 Handicap. With the advantage of pole position and 56.5kg on his back he should be involved in the finish again.
Also worthy of consideration is Corne Spies-trained five-time winner Cape Rebel who will be ridden by Jarryd Penny. He has recorded four wins in seven starts this season with Penny aboard at Fairview. The five-year-old started the season with a splendid hat-trick on turf and then four runs later when switched to the Polytrack he shocked punters with a gutsy close win from a wide draw in Leg 1 of the WSB East Cape Poly Challenge over 1200m.
Best of the others are Lord Marshal, Miracle Bureau and Sao Paulo.
