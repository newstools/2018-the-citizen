The government of Nigeria is scrutinising the reports of the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica, which swiped the data of more than 50 million Facebook users to sway elections in many countries.
The affected countries include Nigeria, where Cambridge Analytica waged a campaign to perpetuate discord and hack into personal records of the then leading opposition candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria’s Premium Times reported.
The federal government has set up an in-house committee to investigate whether Cambridge Analytica’s work for the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2007 and 2015 general elections campaigns broke the law or infringed on the rights of other parties and their candidates.
Should the investigation prove that laws were broken, a special investigator could be appointed which may result in criminal prosecutions by the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami.
Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are the focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office and the United States Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
The UK Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.
