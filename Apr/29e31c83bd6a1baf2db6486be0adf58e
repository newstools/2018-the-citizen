South Africa’s first and much anticipated western, Five Fingers for Marseilles, is set to hit the big screens nationwide tomorrow, production company Be Phat Motel said.
The fast-paced action film will also be released in the US on September 7, starting in New York and Los Angeles, before moving to an additional 15 American cities.
“We are thrilled to be working with the team that produced the Oscar winning films Precious and The Paperboy starring Zac Efron, Matthew McConaughey, Nicole Kidman, and David Oyelowo.
“This is excellent news as it gives the film, which has fairly universal ideas and themes, access to a global cinema audience,” said writer-producer Sean Drummond.
The movie will also be released in Japan and Scandinavia after its release in the US. It will be made available on Amazon Prime, Amazon’s exclusive streaming video on demand service, increasing its reach even further.
Five Fingers for Marseilles tells the story of a group of young men (the ‘Five Fingers’) who stand up to brutal police oppression in Marseilles, a town in the rugged badlands of the Eastern Cape.
Tau, one of the Five Fingers, kills two policemen and is sentenced to 20 years in prison. When he is released, the embittered ‘Lion of Marseilles’ discovers his comrades are now in prominent positions in the town. But there’s also a vicious new threat afoot, prompting Tau to reform the Five Fingers, take on old allies and new enemies.
