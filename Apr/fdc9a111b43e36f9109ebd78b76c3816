A murder suspect in Swaziland has remained incarcerated for nine years without being brought to trial because he could not afford to pay bail, the Swazi Observer has reported.
Fana Shongwe, from Ndlalambi in the Hhohho region, on Wednesday filed an urgent application to the High Court in Mbabane to be released.
He had been granted bail of $4 070 after he was arrested in September 2009 but could not afford to pay it so has been holed up in Sidvwashini Correctional facility ever since.
