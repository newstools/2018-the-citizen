Minister of mineral resources Gwede Mantashe today said it is important for mining companies, labour as well as communities to create partnerships in order for mining to be sustainable.
Speaking at the provincial Mining Indaba in Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal, Mantashe said this would ensure that we realise our objective of a meaningfully transformed, competitive and growing mining sector.
“It is not competitiveness and growth versus transformation. Both are required in order for the sustainability of the sector. We are consulting communities on the Mining Charter. We are focusing on transformation and competitive mining industry,” Mantashe said.
“Mining is one of the key sectors that can assist us to create more black business people, in order for the economy to be more balanced.”
Mantashe also said that it was important to rehabilitate mining sites because it has the potential to create jobs, while restoring the land that has been mined.
The two day Indaba is an opportunity for delegates to deliberate on issues that will help in transforming the sector and unlock mining value chain opportunities in the province.
KwaZulu-Natal currently has 23 operational mines, operating mainly in coal, heavy mineral sands as well as sand and aggregate.
