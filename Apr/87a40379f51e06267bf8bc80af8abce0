Former government minister and now ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula said on Twitter on Sunday that he was born on April Fool’s Day.
He claimed it was no April fool’s joke.
However, his birthday is officially listed as April 8th, though perhaps the internet has that wrong.
The flamboyant politician will be 47 in a week’s time. His middle name is April.
It seems he’s started his birthday celebrations early this year, as the tweets below make clear.


He also seemed to be chilling in a Bheki Cele-type hat on Sunday, pondering the meaning of this day for his Christian beliefs.
