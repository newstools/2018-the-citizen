The biggest “what might have been” question in post-apartheid South Africa is about Chris Hani. What would have happened had the charismatic uMkhonto weSizwe chief of staff not been gunned down that morning in Boksburg 25 years ago? 
Would Thabo Mbeki ever have become the president? Would Jacob Zuma, or even Cyril Ramaphosa for that matter? Would we even know of Julius Malema? 
Hani, Nelson Mandela and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela were, without a doubt, the most popular leaders of the struggle. They were all idolised by black South Africans. So it is not an unreasonable point to ponder whether Hani was robbed of his chance to lead South Africa. 
Hani spent a significant part of his life in the ANC armed wing living not only in harsh conditions, but also with the threat of quick death hanging over his head – would he have “sold out” to the temptations of mega cash at the government feeding trough? Would he have supped with white capital and accepted its billions? Would he ever have become involved in state capture? 
Those who knew Hani, and those who saw him and listened to his words – both in exile and when he returned to the country in the early ’90s – cannot believe he would have done any of those things. 
Under Hani, many believe an ANC government would not have ignored the land issue; would not have ignored the growing poverty gap; would not have allowed racism to fester. 
Intriguing as it is to re-imagine history, though, it will not help us deal with the reality of the desperate problems facing the country. 
But we can use Hani’s example – a belief in all people (black and white); a belief in justice – to help us chart a peaceful way forward.
