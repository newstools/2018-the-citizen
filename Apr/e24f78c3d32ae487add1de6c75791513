At least 150 people were arrested following an outbreak of violent protests in the North West, provincial police said on Thursday.
Spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the arrests were made on Wednesday night in Jouberton near Klerksdorp and Sannieshof and police recovered goods that were looted from various businesses during the day.
“Recovered goods include groceries, clothes, liquor, cash dispensing machine, vehicles used in the transportation of stolen goods, a casket as well as equipment which was robbed from South African Broadcasting [SABC] television crew in Jouberton, Extension 1,” Mokgwabone said.
“The  [SABC] equipment which is worth R300,000 was found at a residence in Extension 20 following positive information given to the police. These recoveries and arrests follow those made last week in Mmabatho and Mahikeng where material stolen from a looted local hardware business was recovered.”
More than 400 people were arrested since the outbreak of the violent marred protests in Mahikeng on April 18, residents went on a rampage looting and barricading roads demanding that North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo must resign.
The protests have since spread to other places such as Itsoseng, Delareyville, Taung, Pudimoe, Christiana, Dryharts, Khuma, Ikageng, Kanana, Alabama, Sannieshof, Jouberton, Schweizer-Reneke, Bakerville, Coligny and Blydeville.
“The arrests include five suspects that were apprehended in Taung for attempted murder of a member of Community Policing Forum.”
The arrested people are expected to appear in various courts in the province where they would among others face charges of sedition, contravention of Criminal Matters Amendment Act and possession of suspected stolen goods.
