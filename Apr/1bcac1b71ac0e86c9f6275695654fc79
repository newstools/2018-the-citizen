The EFF and others who love the “colonialism” and “white monopoly capital” narratives have been bleating their disgust at the meeting at Windsor Castle between President Cyril Ramaphosa and Queen Elizabeth II. 
Ramaphosa’s critics will have seen in his visit clear evidence that he takes his orders from Western imperialists in their sinister plot to suppress the entire continent of Africa. 
The reality is somewhat different. 
As head of state, he is there to represent South Africa at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference. And while in the United Kingdom, Ramaphosa has continued in his role as SA’s number one cheerleader. 
He is there to tell everybody who will listen that South Africa is open for business – and that the era of Zuma and state capture has been left behind. 
And it is exactly those things his opponents criticise him for – his charisma, his relaxed way with the world’s most powerful people and his infectious optimism – which could start opening cheque books for SA. 
A lot of people – even those sympathetic to SA – are worried about issues like land expropriation without compensation and Ramaphosa has the ability and experience to respond to those concerns.
