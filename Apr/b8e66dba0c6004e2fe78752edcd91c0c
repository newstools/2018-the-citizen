The Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) and SA Revenue Service (Sars) targeted the Gupta compound in Saxonwold on Monday afternoon.
The AFU and Sars arrived at the compound at about 2pm to find resistance from someone reported to be a Gupta lawyer refusing them entry.
Both Sars and the AFU gained access into the property moments after anyway.
Sars and the AFU were there to attach assets that are apparently critical to the Vrede investigation.
National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku issued a statement that confirmed the AFU had obtained an order in April 2017 related to the Vrede dairy project.
He said the order related to more than R250 million linked to fraud, corruption and money laundering that allegedly took place between 2012 and 2017.




Mfaku said: “The order makes provision for the restraint of several assets to the value of R250 202 652.00, pending the finalisation of the criminal trial and, upon conviction, the AFU will apply for a confiscation order for the recovery of the said amount and or any related amounts.
“Amongst the assets forming part of the restraint order include the following: immovable property, two aircrafts, a helicopter, vehicles and bank accounts belonging to certain entities, namely, Oakbay Investments, Islandsite Investments 180, Confident Concepts, Sahara Computers and Westdawn Investments and Aerohaven Trading,” said Mfaku in a statement.
