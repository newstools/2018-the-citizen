The mother of an infant thrown off a roof by its father was taken into police custody on Friday.
The mother was released after police confirmed she was only taken in for questioning, Butterworth police spokesperson Andre Beetge confirmed on Jacaranda FM.


Social services have intervened in one of the most daring displays of cruelty after a father tossed his child off the roof of a shack on Thursday.
The Motherwell Cluster Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual offices unit have intervened, and will supervise the child’s wellbeing.
The one-year-old child was confirmed safe and the father arrested on a charge of attempted murder.
The 38-year-old man is expected to appear in court on Monday.

The child was returned to the 35-year-old mother, according to Beetge.
The father’s actions of defiance were in protest of his house being demolished.
Demolition of several shacks in the Nelson Mandela Bay were part of a police operation reclaiming municipal land.
Answers to why the father tossed his baby off the roof will be answered when the 38-year-old man appears in court next week.
