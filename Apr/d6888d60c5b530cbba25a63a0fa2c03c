South Africa’s Caster Semenya claimed her second gold medal of the games with victory in the women’s 800m in a time of one minute 56.68 seconds at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games on Friday.
Semenya won the title in a new games record, with Kenya’s Margaret Wambui second in 1:58.07 with Jamaica’s Natoya Goule third in 1:58.82.
Semenya added to her gold in the women’s 1500m earlier in the week to complete a rare double gold in the middle distance events.
The 27-year-old moved into the lead from the first bend and took the field through 400m in 58 seconds. With a gap of a couple of metres, Semenya waited until the 600m mark to surge ahead.
From that point victory seemed assured as the Olympic champion completed a dominant performance.
