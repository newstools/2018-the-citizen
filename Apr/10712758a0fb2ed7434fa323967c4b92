South African film Five Fingers for Marseilles, starring Vuyo Dabula, made a significant debut at the box office by raking in more than R500 000 in ticket sales.
The film has outperformed past South African favourites in the action/crime/drama genres, with a showing that was 28 percent stronger than Inumber Number (2013), 31 percent stronger than Jerusalema (2008) and 34 percent higher than Noem My Skollie (2016), and 40 percent higher than Hard to Get (2014) on its opening weekend.
It was the number one film at Rosebank Nouveau, in Johannesburg. At other sites it played ahead of Black Panther, but just behind Tyler Perry’s Acrimony. These cinema sites included Sterland, Loch Logan and Newtown over the weekend.
“We had high expectations for the film,” says Helen Kuun, MD of Indigenous Film Distribution.
“We always knew it was something special from the first screenings. It’s all about great storytelling and a spectacular cast.”
Sean Drummond wrote the impressive Five Fingers for Marseilles script.
Owing to the positive response the film will be screened at four additional sites this week to the meet public demand – at Festival Mall in Pretoria, and at Sandton City, Vaal Mall in Vanderbijlpark and Mimosa Mall in Bloemfontein.
The film has had rave reviews from local critics, with The Sowetan calling it “one of the best local productions ever made”.
The Sunday Times described it as “the South Africa Avengers”, while The Independent called it “a star-studded, genre-bending film”.
Channel 24 said it is “a great local film that should be praised for more than just being a western”, and City Press named it “a true spectacle”, and “one for the history books.”
Five Fingers for Marseilles was awarded Best South African Film in Development at the Durban FilmMart’s finance forum in 2013.
