Classy sprinter Tevez, Silicone Valley and Dutch Philip will renew their rivalry at Kenilworth today in Race 6, a Pinnacle Stakes over 1200m.



They last appeared in different contest on Sun Met Day at the end of January, and Silicone Valley is a narrow first selection.
This seven-year-old has well documented soundness issues, but always comes to the track ready to roll, and holds his two classy rivals on his win in the Grade 2 Merchants last December.
In addition the welcome rain fell this week will also help soothe his dodgy pins.
Trainer Candice Bass-Robinson was yesterday unsure of the plans for exciting youngster Dutch Philip.
“We may run him in the Tsogo Sun at Scottsville at the end of May depending on what weight he gets, but nothing is decided. He will run well here, while needing it a bit,” she said.


His stable mate Tevez by contrast is now a veteran, like the footballer he is named after. He still regularly puts in a sterling effort however, and will be making his presence felt at the finish.
“He sometimes doesn’t perform at his best after a rest but is very well in himself and on his work will be right there,” Bass- Robinson said.
Vincente and Quickfire make most appeal of the remainder.
A potential good Eachway bet presents itself in Race 1.
Dean Kannemeyer’s Seatttle Kid caught the eye running on strongly late on debut behind Sailor Sam in what has turned out to be a strong form race.
He then had excuses from a wide draw last time, and if repeating his debut effort will be heavily involved in the finish.
Blue Roller looks a good Win bet in Race 2. He was no match for impressive debut winner and Winter Guineas entry Rainbow Bridge first time out, but finished well clear of the remainder.
There is nothing near that class here, although Joey Ramsden has a couple of well-bred juveniles.
