The City of Cape Town on Thursday announced Lungelo Mbandazayo as the metro’s s new manager, following on from previous City Manager Achmat Ebrahim who resigned at the start of the year.
According to a statement from the City of Cape Town, Mbandazayo’s appointment was approved by councillors during a Council meeting on Wednesday.
The position became vacant after former city manager Ebrahim tendered his resignation on January 12.
Council approved Mbandazayo’s appointment for a five-year term. He has previously held positions in the City as the director of legal services and as executive director of corporate services and has been acting as city manager since the beginning of the year.
Ebrahim resigned amid the political battle involving Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille and her own political party the Democratic Alliance (DA) which accused her of a range of offences including mismanagement and corruption.
Among the allegations made against De Lille was that she told Ebrahim not to report allegations of misconduct and tender irregularities against the commissioner of the transport and urban development authority, Melissa Whitehead, to the city council.
