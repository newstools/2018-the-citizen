Pierre Schoeman of the Bulls has been cited by Sanzaar for allegedly biting an opponent during Saturday’s  Super Rugby match against the Melbourne Rebels in Pretoria the weekend.
Loose forward Richard Hardwick was supposedly bitten.
Schoeman will appear before Sanzaar’s foul play review committee and the case is to be heard on Monday afternoon.
Schoeman wasn’t penalised for the alleged foul play, which occurred in the 58th minute of the Rebels’ 28-10 loss.
However, after further investigation, the citing commissioner deemed the incident had met the red card threshold. – African News Agency (ANA)
