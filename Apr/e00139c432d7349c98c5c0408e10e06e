Former Cape Town SABC radio DJ Dino Michael and wife Janine are out on bail after appearing in Cape Town Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.
Dino Michael was released on R50 000 bail, with his wife Janine granted R10 000 bail.
Drugs worth R2.6 million were allegedly found in the couple’s home in Tamboerskloof on Tuesday.
The couple was arrested by the Hawks after cocaine and MDMA, as well as R300 000 in cash, were seized during the police raid of their home.
Police said Dino in court claimed he was suffering from chronic asthma and a heart condition, and gave these as reasons to be granted bail.
The couple with no previous convictions said their 12-year-old needed them, as they depended on them both emotionally and financially.
The couple is reported to have pleaded not guilty, and are both barred from leaving the Western Cape as part of their bail terms.
They will be appearing in the Cape Town Magistrates’ Court on July 12.
