The Presidential guard, ordinary members of the South African Police Service (SAPS), and metro police have thrown a ring of steel around the Durban High Court ahead of Jacob Zuma’s appearance on corruption charges today.
There’s still little sign of the massive promised prayer group and “Hands off Zuma” protesters who held a night vigil until the early hours of this morning.


Zuma is appearing on 12 counts of fraud, two of corruption, one of money laundering, and one of racketeering related to 783 payments allegedly made to and on behalf of Zuma by Schabir Shaik and his Nkobi Group totalling more than R4 million.
Shaik was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2005 over the same issues however in 2009 Shaik was released on medical parole, after serving two years and four months of his prison term.
Zuma is likely to say he had no intention to commit fraud however at this stage it is unclear what legal gymnastics his defence team will be performing.
Kemp J Kemp will be appearing for Zuma, while Billy Downer, who  successfully prosecuted Schabir Schaik against Zuma nine is believed to be stepping up for the State today.
