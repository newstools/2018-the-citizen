South African Revenue Service (Sars) customs officials at OR Tambo International Airport (ORTIA) seized over 100 kilogrammes of drugs worth an estimated R30 million.
In a statement Friday, Sars spokesperson Sandile Memela further confirmed that during the past financial year, Sars customs had seized illicit and counterfeit goods worth over R2.3 billion. Sars said this week customs officials confiscated 108kg of drugs that were hidden in boxes and declared as “calcium carbonate” at ORTIA.
“Officials inspected the boxes in the cargo section at ORTIA after they arrived from Kenya on Tuesday,” Memela said. “They discovered a white powdery substance and a brown sand-like substance, which they sent to a private laboratory for testing. The results came back positive for the drug ketamine [the white powdery substance] and Acetylanthranil, a base ingredient for Methaqualone [mandrax].”
The case was handed over to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) for further investigation.
In a separate incident, a truck leaving Lesotho was stopped on Thursday at Ficksburg border post in the Free State and searched after the driver acted suspiciously. Customs officials then discovered 207 bags filled with cannabis weighing over 6 000 kilogrammes. The total value of the cannabis is more than R9 million. The driver was taken into police custody.
SARS Customs also also released statistics for the total number of busts which took place over the past financial year, with the combined value of goods confiscated from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 amounting to over R 2.3-billion.
