Two police constables, aged 37 and 34, were arrested while on duty in Hartswater on Sunday after they were found in possession of suspected stolen cellphones, Northern Cape police said.
The cellphones were reported stolen from a local furniture store in Hartswater. The cellphones and many other items, including television sets and other electric appliances, were stolen during recent service delivery protests where looting was the order of the day, Captain Olebogeng Tawana said.
The two arrested police officers were also “seen being part of community members who looted business premises” in Hartswater and Pampierstad.
The arrests followed after police crime intelligence, counter intelligence, K9 unit, tactical response team, public order policing, and Hartswater police officers followed up on information which implicated the duo in criminal activities during the looting and protests in Hartswater, Tawana said.
During their arrest early on Sunday morning, the two were found in possession of suspected stolen cellphones. The matter was handed to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) for further investigation.
More arrests were imminent and the investigation continued, Tawana said.
