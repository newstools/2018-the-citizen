The power utility said in a statement on Tuesday that Tim Bruinders, who was appointed to chair a disciplinary hearing convened to consider disciplinary charges levelled against Masango, had found him not guilty.
Eskom interim group chief executive Phakamani Hadebe said the company never wanted to subject any employee to a disciplinary process with a predetermined outcome, but rather to look at all allegations with a fresh pair of eyes and ensure that a fair, thorough and independent process was undertaken.
“Eskom respects the outcome of the disciplinary process held for Mr Masango and will negotiate a date for his return to Eskom with him in due course,” Hadebe said.
Masango was suspended last November following a forensic investigation, on charges of serious misconduct for allegedly receiving kickbacks in relation to Eskom’s Kusile power station.
Masango has worked at Eskom for more than 20 years and is a former project director of Kusile, one of the power utility’s biggest stations. He was a key witness in a disciplinary hearing against former acting chief executive Matshela Koko.
Testifying before a parliamentary inquiry into allegations of state capture at Eskom in February, Masango told legislators how he was targeted, intimidated and threatened after compiling a “whistle-blower’s report” containing concerns about corruption at the utility.
Masango said he submitted the report to former Eskom chairman Ben Ngubane, who was implicated in former public protector Thuli Madonsela’s report detailing how the politically connected Gupta family influenced decisions at the state firm, making billions of rands as a result.
