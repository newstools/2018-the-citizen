DA leader Mmusi Maimane was quoted in the Sunday Times on his reflections about the recent vote of no confidence drama in Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip
The attempt from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) floundered on Thursday after it became obvious it did not have the support of enough opposition parties to succeed.
Maimane was quoted as saying that “Things [with the EFF] were fine until they [the ANC] removed [president Jacob] Zuma … which begs the question: was the party formed just in opposition to Zuma?”
He also speculated on whether the EFF and ANC were now forming a new coalition to “bring chaos and a fairly racist agenda” as they cosied up to each other.
Maimane said he would not sacrifice DA principle to retain power in coalition metros, though he insisted that the DA still had a good relationship with EFF leader Julius Malema, who brought the vote against Trollip following the DA’s refusal to support land expropriation without compensation.
Malema had said that they could no longer support a white mayor in Port Elizabeth. He has vowed to keep trying to get rid of Trollip.
“We differ on a policy [issue],” Maimane was quoted as saying.
Speculation has abounded on whether the EFF may now turn on the DA in Tshwane and Johannesburg.
Maimane is understood to be in an internal battle with other DA leaders about changes to the party’s constitution that will bring about greater racial diversity and perhaps extend DA leaders’ terms to five years, from three.
MP and parliamentary chief whip John Steenhuisen has written an internal party letter in opposition to the term change, saying it is required to keep party leadership as accountable as possible.
The DA leader has taken a strong position in the lead-up to the DA’s conference, which he is widely expected to win, that he is in charge of the party and not a proxy for other leaders such as James Selfe and Helen Zille.
