The incident took place at about 5.10pm at Manny’s Meat Market on Main Road in that took place in Newlands, Randburg, reports the Roodepoort Record.
According to the manager, this is an extremely busy time for the Johannesburg butchery.
About six men entered the butchery, at least one of them carrying a firearm. They demanded cash but did not want the money from the cash register. They insisted on going to the back of the shop where the safe was. A scuffle broke out and the manager was hit with a firearm. He then ran outside and flagged down a taxi to take him to Sophiatown Police Station.
On the manager’s return with the police, he found the supervisor lying on the floor with two gunshot wounds to her head. CCTV footage shows that she put up a fight with one of the armed robbers before being shot at point blank range.

The robbers fled without taking any money.
The victim was rushed to Milpark Hospital. Doctors are currently waiting for the head swelling to subside before deciding what the next step will be. Both bullets are still lodged in her head.
