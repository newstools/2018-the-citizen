Traffic are going to be diverted on roads around Orlando Stadium in Soweto tomorrow to accommodate a memorial service for the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.
Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the roads will be closed from 7pm tonight.
“Motorists will not be allowed access into Mooki Street between Soweto Highway and Sofasonke Street. Klipspruitvalley Road will be blocked off between the N17 circle and Khumalo Street. Only residents can obtain access permits from Orlando Police Station,” said Minnaar.
“Mourners will not be allowed to drive through the cordoned off area and will have to park at Nasrec Expo Centre from where they will be ferried by buses to the stadium.”
He said roads will be reopened after the memorial service at 6pm and the Rea Vaya bus  route will not be affected.
