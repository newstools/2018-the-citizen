It is worrying that the Gauteng department of education is being forced to consider deploying armed guards to schools in Atteridgeville, Pretoria, in a desperate effort to combat a housebreaking syndicate which has been targeting the schools for the last six years. 
Gauteng MEC Panyaza Lesufi informed the Gauteng Legislature that, in the past four years, 27 schools had been broken into in a total of 101 incidents. 
One school has been hit 20 times this year. 
There are other disturbing features about these cases. Despite all the complaints laid and dockets opened with the police, investigators have come up with nothing so far. 
Even worse, none of the schools have received any feedback or update from the police. 
The department should not have to place armed guards at schools – but we support Lesufi and his team if they believe this is the way to tackle the situation. 
However, the reality is – according to DA shadow education MEC Khume Ramulifho – that the criminals will continue to hit schools as long as people in the community are prepared to buy their stolen goods. 
The community must realise this is not a victimless crime. 
Those who suffer are their children.
