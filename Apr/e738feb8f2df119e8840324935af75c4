The African National Congress (ANC) in the North West on Thursday, accepted defeat during ward 15’s by-election in Coligny in the Ditsobotla municipality.
“We thank all our volunteers for the commitment demonstrated towards the work of the ANC. We also extend our gratitude to all the voters who voted ANC and continued to show trust, belief and confidence in their organisation,” said acting provincial secretary Sussana Dantjie.
The ANC lost the ward to the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).
Bongani Patrick Cekiso of the EFF won the seat with 36.48 percent of the votes cast compared to 54.79 percent that the ANC received in the 2016 Municipal Elections.  Voter turnout was 48.67 percent.
The EFF said their victory in Coligny was a signal that the EFF was a beacon of hope to the “hopeless masses” of  people in the North West Province.
“We salute the ward 15 branch command team, our tireless volunteers, provincial elections team, our public representatives and all ground forces for their efforts and commitments for making it possible.  This is a signal that the EFF is a beacon of hope to the hopeless masses of our people in the North West Province,” said provincial spokesperson Baruti Daniel Sephelle in a statement.
Dantjie said despite the lost in Coligny, the ANC remains an overwhelming majority in the Ditsobotla municipality.
“We’re still prepared to work together with our people of Ward 15 to correct that which they see as inadequate on our part,” she said.
