Congolese President Denis Sassou Ngueso on Saturday paid tribute to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, describing her as a source of inspiration for people of the African continent.
“She was committed to the honourable course, despite the risks she faced. She was able to provide warmth to her family as a protective mother and grandmother,” Ngueso said at the struggle icon’s funeral at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto, Johannesburg.
Nambian President Hage Geingob said Madikizela-Mandela had never elevated herself above ordinary people.
“She was rooted to the people even when she was appointed to high office. We stand together with the people of South Africa and the brothers and sisters in the ANC,” he said.
