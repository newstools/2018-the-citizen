A strike by bus drivers today boosted business for taxi drivers who did not have to drive around scouting for passengers as they normally would.
Commuters across the country were left stranded after bus drivers affiliated to the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu), the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the Transport and Omnibus Workers’ Union (Towu) boycotted work, demanding a minimum monthly salary of R8 000.
The workers effectively want a 12 percent salary increase against the seven percent employers have offered, and have also demanded that night shifts be scheduled from 4 pm to 6 am, while also asking for better accommodation and compensation for sleeping out.
Taxi driver Mafika Sibeko said he symphathised with the striking workers, but was happy for the resulting extra business for him.
“Usually it is hard to get people going to Rustenburg town, but today I did not struggle,” Sibeko said.
“People were grouped everywhere along the road. We were calling each other on where to find people as they are waiting.”
Satawu spokesperson Zanele Sabela said the bus strike would continue indefinitely.
“It is certain that it will go on till the negotiations are over. There is no guarantee as to when will we reach an agreement,” Sabela said.
