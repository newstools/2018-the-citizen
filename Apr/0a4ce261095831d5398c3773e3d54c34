Government is set to launch a provincial InvestSA One Stop Shop (OSS) in Gauteng in a bid to attract investment in the province, the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) said on Monday.
The dti said that the objective of the provincial InvestSA OSS is to provide professional service to all investors through specialist advisory, reduce regulatory inefficiencies, and reduce red tape for investors looking to invest in Gauteng.
The Gauteng InvestSA OSS will be launched by the dti Minister Dr. Rob Davies, together with Gauteng Premier David Makhura on Tuesday in Sandton.
The InvestSA OSS is a Presidential programme to promote and facilitate investment in South Africa.
Davies said that the provincial One Stop Shop investment centres that were being rolled out in all the provinces will be used to co-ordinate and incorporate the special economic zones, provincial investment agencies, local authorities and the relevant government departments involved in regulatory, registration, permits and licensing matters.
“Gauteng Province is an economic hub for South Africa’s investment opportunities abound in a number of sectors of the economy and hosts major multi-national companies that are increasing their investment in South Africa,” Davies said.
“The launch will strengthen coordination in the three metros and economic corridors in the province together with other departments and agencies under one roof.”
Gauteng is leading sub-national destination for foreign direct investment into the African continent.
