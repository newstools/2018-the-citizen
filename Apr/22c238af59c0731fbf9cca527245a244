A Durban North family escaped serious injury after they were hijacked in their friend’s driveway just before midnight on Thursday, reports Northglen News.
The incident occurred on Armstrong Avenue as the family drove into their friend’s driveway. The video shows the armed men run into the property with guns drawn just as the electronic gates begin to close.
The armed men, who were using a red Polo, had allegedly followed the residents and waited for the right moment to strike.
The terrifying ordeal was captured on video and shared on the news alert system, Sun Cell Watch, run by Craig Adendorff.

Marshall Security’s Kyle van Reenen said: “The armed suspects, using a red Polo, held the family up before making off with the vehicle, a white BMW. One of the occupants dropped his iPhone in the vehicle during the ordeal. The tracking details were obtained and a positive signal was received.
“We eventually found the vehicle, with the assistance of the police K9 Unit, abandoned on the roadside not far from Emachobeni Primary School in Inanda. The vehicle was handed over to Durban North SAPS.”
The hijacking suspects remain at large.
The recovery came hours before the arrest of three men in connection with a string of motorbike thefts in the greater Durban area.
