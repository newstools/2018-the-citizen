Internal problems cost the ANC a seat in the ward by-election in Coligny, North West premier and ANC chairman Supra Mahumapelo said on Friday.
He said the selection process for the candidate was flawed. 
“The candidate’s name was finalised on the day before the names were submitted to the IEC and the process was flawed,” he said, reacting to the results of the by-election at ward 15 of the Ditsobotla local municipality.
“The reasons we have lost are not external they are internal. We did not make sure that the selection process of the candidate was the most perfect all-inclusive democratic process. There are people who are not happy about the candidate.
“The second reason why we lost it is because of our own internal differences within the branch in Ward 15 in Coligny, so we must address that problem,” he said.
Mahumapelo, who is facing a wave of protests demanding his resignation, said the other reason for the defeat was a lack of service delivery in the area, which angered the community.
Bongani Patrick Cekiso of the Economic Freedom Fighters narrowly won the by-election with 36.48 percent of the votes cast compared to 54.79 percent that the ANC received in the 2016 municipal elections.  
Voter turnout was 48.67 percent. 
According to the results released by the Electoral Commission of SA (IEC), the EFF won by 11 votes, with the party receiving 699 votes and the ANC 688, the DA 374 and the Freedom Front Plus 124, while an independent candidate received 32 votes. – African News Agency (ANA)
