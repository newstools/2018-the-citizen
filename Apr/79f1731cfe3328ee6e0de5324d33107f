President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the official memorial service for Winnie Madikizela-Mandela will be held on 11 April.
On 14 April, the official funeral service for the former freedom fighter will be held in Orlando Stadium in Soweto.
He told mourners outside her home in Orlando West, Soweto, that Madikizela-Mandela remained strong and “stubborn on behalf of our people” during the apartheid era, and she continued to show courage in the face of apartheid oppression.
Her departure is a real loss and we as South Africans are all mourning, the president said.
