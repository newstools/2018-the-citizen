Five people were arrested in connection with the death of six mine workers who were burnt beyond recognition when their work bus was petrol bombed, Limpopo police said today.
”Five suspects aged between 21 and 30 for the horrific incident in which six mine workers were killed in a bus on Monday evening. The investigation team that was established to track down these killers, spent two sleepless nights since the incident was reported and arrested the five at different locations,” said spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo.
Police offered a R500 000 reward for information on those responsible for the gruesome attack on Monday night, that left six workers burnt beyond recognition and 28 others severely injured. The workers were en route to a night shift at Modikwa platinum mine, jointly owned by Africa Rainbow Minerals (ARM) and Anglo American Platinum.
Mojapelo would not comment on whether the five were employed at the mine.
”They will all appear in Mecklenburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday on charges of six counts of murder, malicious damage to property and attempted murder. Further information and their identities will be revealed after the court appearance,” he said.
The meticulous task of of identifying the six deceased has started and their identities would be revealed at a later stage, said Mojapelo.
More arrests are expected as police investigations continue.
