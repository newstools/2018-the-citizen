One thing you cannot say about Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille is that she is shy and retiring. And perhaps that is one of her traits which makes the Democratic Alliance hierarchy uncomfortable. 
She does not hesitate to speak her mind – or to take actions which, she believes, are in the best interests of her constituents … or herself. 
So it was no surprise to see her on stage as a guest speaker at a memorial for Winnie Madikizela-Mandela organised by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The only surprise is that the DA leadership – specially its federal council – professed surprise at De Lille. They are certainly grumpy because she attended – not, apparently, because she was there, but that she did not notify the higher-ups before going. 
De Lille appears to be deliberately baiting the party leaders, who already appear determined to get rid of her over alleged mismanagement of Cape Town. In addition, the party’s recent congress passed what is coming to be called the “De Lille clause” which, broadly speaking, enables undisciplined members to be removed. 
We are not sure that going after De Lille is the wisest course of action for the DA in the wake of the flirting with the EFF. De Lille, clearly, would love nothing more than to make herself a martyr … and perhaps to justify why she would move to a more “revolutionary” party than the DA. 
On the other hand, her core supporters in the Western Cape might not have been happy with her choice of potential new bedfellows, so she could have hurt herself in the process. 
The DA must move carefully with De Lille. She offers a lot to the party, especially now that its ANC opponents have moved to remove the rot in their own ranks. 
Whatever happens, though, De Lille spices up our politics …
