News channel eNCA reports that in investigating the area around Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s Soweto home after gunshots were fired, the “suspects” turned out to be Umkhonto weSizwe military veterans (MKMVA).
The police minister, Bheki Cele, confirmed to the channel that they had found spent cartridges on the pavement across the road from her Orlando home. No one appeared to have been hurt.
They report that firing such gunshots is part of a tradition when “an honoured person dies”.
Many mourners have made their way to the house over the past week since Madikizela-Mandela passed away on Monday afternoon following a struggle with illness at the age of 81.
She will be buried next weekend.
