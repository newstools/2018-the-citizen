A source told the South Coast Herald that a holidaymaker visiting the beach with his family made the gruesome discovery. The holidaymaker initially thought it was a dead fish, but upon closer inspection saw it was a person.
He reported it to the control tower, and crew from National Sea Rescue Institute and police divers were dispatched.
Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Zandra Wiid said there was reportedly a wound on the man’s body, but was unable to say exactly where.
The body may have been in the water for quite some time.
