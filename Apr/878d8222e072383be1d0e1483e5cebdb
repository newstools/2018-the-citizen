Police have arrested four men in the Nyanga area in Cape Town in connection with murder, possession of a stolen vehicle, and culpable homicide, Western Cape police said on Sunday.
Two suspects,  aged 32 and 26, were apprehended for murder, Captain FC van Wyk said.
The 26-year-old man was arrested soon after 3am on Saturday morning after he allegedly stabbed another young man in Lusaka, Nyanga. The 32-year-old man was arrested at about 9am on Sunday, “also for stabbing another victim”.
“The victim was walking with his friend in Sikwenene Street, Browns Farm when they met with the suspect who allegedly just stabbed the deceased for no reason,” he said.
The third suspect, a 37-year-old man, was arrested after he had been found stripping a vehicle in Dubu Street in Browns Farm which had reportedly been hijacked.
The fourth suspect was arrested for culpable homicide. He allegedly knocked down a six-year-old girl in an accident in Sibini Avenue, Zwelitsha in Nyanga. The girl sustained serious head and leg injuries and later succumbed to her injuries.
The four arrested men will appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court next week on charges of murder, culpable homicide, and possession of a stolen vehicle, Van Wyk said.
