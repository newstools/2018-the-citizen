It is hard to believe that just short of a month ago the Australian cricket team had taken a 1-0 lead in the four-match Test series in Durban against the Proteas.
This week they leave the country in tatters, having lost the series 3-1 after losing the next three Tests by six wickets in Port Elizabeth, 322 runs in Cape Town and yesterday by a whopping 492 runs at the Wanderers – their first Test series defeat to the Proteas in South Africa since 1970.
In all fairness, the Australians arrived at the Wanderers yesterday with one foot on the plane and the loss of their final seven wickets for just 31 runs in just over an hour was a mere formality after enduring a painful 10 days since the ball-tampering scandal rocked the sport on the third day of the third Test in Cape Town.
It’s a tour the Australians will want to forget quickly. They axed and sent home early both captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner for their roles in the scandal, while young Cameron Bancroft also returned early. All three were hit with heavy sanctions, while their coach Darren Lehmann has since resigned.
South African fans take great delight when any of their sporting teams or individuals put one past Australia. As ruthless and clinical as the Proteas were, even the most die-hard supporter has to feel some sympathy for the manner in which the tourists disintegrated.
