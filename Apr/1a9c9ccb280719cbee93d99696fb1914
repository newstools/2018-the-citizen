Under-fire Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has told News24 she will seek legal advice after the Democratic Alliance adopted a constitutional amendment that will ensure that DA members elected to executive positions and who lack competence can be recalled.
De Lille told News24 she “needed clarity on whether the clause could be applied retrospectively” but she would continue the fight to clear her name.
“I am proceeding with all the things that I’m busy with. There is still a high court case pending that the so-called Steenhuisen report [which made damning findings against her] be reviewed,” she was quoted as saying.
DA federal council chairperson James Selfe reportedly confirmed to News24 at the conference that they had no intention to apply the clause to De Lille retrospectively and her disciplinary process would therefore continue. However, they would possibly consider the new rules should a fresh motion of no confidence be brought.
The amendment states that a member will be given a chance to make representations and will have to resign within 48 hours. Failure to do so will lead to the cessation of their membership.
The resolution was tabled and adopted on Sunday at the DA’s federal congress under way at the Tshwane Events Centre in Pretoria.
This comes after the party became embroiled in a conflict with De Lille and failed to remove her in a motion of no confidence in the city council. De Lille’s future as a DA member and mayor has been hanging in the balance following various allegations, including security upgrades at her residence, mismanagement, and corruption. She has already survived a motion of no confidence brought against her.
Before the amendment, the party’s federal council had no powers to compel a public representative to be removed from public office.
