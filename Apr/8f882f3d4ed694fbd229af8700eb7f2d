Monday’s cartoon by The Citizen’s cartoonist Themba Siwela has generated much discussion and reaction, with some praising it as good satire and others disappointed at what they reckon is a cartoonist who’s gone too far and is being disrespectful.
The cartoon mirrors other cartoons that have in the past lampooned the president for fathering so many children, some of them out of wedlock.
The son that was born to his new fiancee earlier this month is understood to be his 23rd child. There is an age gap of 52 years between Zuma (76) and Nonkanyiso Conco (24).
What do you think of the cartoon?
