Cassper Nyovest has just released his latest music video on Freedom Day and it enjoyed a lot of attention in particular from the Economic Freedom Fighters for its portrayal of land reform.
EFF leader Julius Malema tweeted: “Thank you very much my brother @CassperNyovest for the powerful music video, the message is very clear that indeed when we get our land #ksazobalit. #WeAreReady #LandIsDignity.”


In the video Cassper is wearing a farmer’s outfit and dancing among the fields. He also drives an old tractor around, much to the apparent consternation of a big white farmer coming out of his farmhouse.
A hip-hop dance crew does its moves in a field while there’s even a cameo from choreographer and presenter star Somizi driving a big delivery truck.
There’s also more humour in the video, since the farmer starts to join in by dancing and joining a meal at the end of the video.
A cameo of Pearl Thusi on a horse also reveals that the apparent “feud” between Cassper and Thusi on Thursday was nothing more than a publicity stunt.
The message of the song centres on black people reclaiming land.
The EFF, which successfully tabled a motion in parliament in March to have the constitution changed to allow for land expropriation without compensation, said in a tweet: “Fellow South Africans & fighters, let’s all watch @CassperNyovest’s #KsazobalitMusicVide be inspired on #FreedomDay! It breaks the stereotype that youth, particularly in the urban of pop cultures like hip hop, are not interested in the land. #WeAreReady.”
