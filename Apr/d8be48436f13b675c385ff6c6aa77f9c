Bullion company Gold Fields said on Wednesday its gold production for the quarter ended March fell one percent to 490 000 ounces compared with the same period last year, and was down 10 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.
Following a strong year in 2017, the Damang reinvestment project progressed according to plan in the first quarter of 2018, but the Gruyere project was affected by severe weather and South Deep performed below expectation, Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland said.
Holland said South Deep had a tough start to 2018, with production in Q1 up four percent on a year/year basis, but 41 percent lower quarter-on-quarter at 48 000 ounces.
“Production for the quarter was impacted by the slow production build up after the seasonal holidays; two labour restructuring processes that took place at the end of 2017 and during the quarter; and a change in underground working shift arrangements implemented to increase productivity,” he said.
He said Gold Fields did not not expect the 321 000 ounces production guidance provided at the start of the year for South Deep to be achieved, and was currently forecasting production of 244 000 ounces for the year.
“As a result of the revised South Deep production outlook mentioned above, attributable equivalent gold production for the group for 2018 is expected to be between 2.0 million ounces and 2.05 million ounces,” Holland added.
