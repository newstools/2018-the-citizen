June Steenkamp, mother of Reeva, who was murdered by Oscar Pistorius, says she has had enough of hearing about the former Paralympian … and so have we. 
Pistorius has reached the end of the legal road in trying to keep himself out of prison, following the decision this week by the Constitutional Court to dismiss his application for leave to appeal. Its reason was that the issue did not fall within its jurisdiction as the highest court in the land. 
It is time for all of us to move on – and to recognise that our justice system has arrived at a conclusion which, in our view, reflects the reality that Pistorius took the life of another human and in a manner which cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as an act of self-defence. 
The case did, however, give us as a nation the opportunity to not only look on, in voyeuristic fashion, at a human tragedy, but should have given us pause to think about the broader question of violence against women in general. 
A foundation set up in Reeva’s name, led by June, will be educating young people about violence against women. 
So, while Pistorius serves his time, Reeva’s spirit will serve our nation.
