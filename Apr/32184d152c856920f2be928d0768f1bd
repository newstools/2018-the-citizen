Eight men accused of plotting to kill Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) leaders arrived at the Brits Magistrates’ Court under heavy police guard on Friday.
The accused, who face charges of conspiracy to murder and attempted murder, will continue with their bid to be released on bail.
The state alleges the men were expelled from Amcu as the union then appointed new leaders and the group plotted to “take them out of office”.
Amcu branch chairman Malibongwe Mdazo was shot and wounded in Mooinooi outside Brits on 22 July 2017.
The state contends that three hit men were paid R50 000 for each hit. They allegedly identified five Amcu leaders who were to be shot dead in order to render the union weak in the North West platinum belt.
On Friday Amcu members gathered outside the court to protest during the bail hearing.
