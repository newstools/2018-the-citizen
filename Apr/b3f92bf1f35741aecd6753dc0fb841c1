Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu has extended her condolences to the family of former ambassador and government minister Dr Zola Skweyiya who died in a Johannesburg hospital this morning. He was 75 years old.
Skweyiya served as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.
Skweyiya, who died after a short illness, served as minister of public service and administration in former president Nelson Mandela’s Cabinet and then as minister of social development during Thabo Mbeki’s administration.
“He crafted the ethos of Batho Pele. He lived them and insisted that the public service is professional and all public servants serve the people with the same commitment and dedication. He also extended his professionalism and commitment to the diplomatic family when he was appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Ireland, young people learnt a lot from him”, said Sisulu in a statement.
“He has left us with a lot of intellectual inheritance. We were very fortunate to have him in the diplomatic family,” added Sisulu.
