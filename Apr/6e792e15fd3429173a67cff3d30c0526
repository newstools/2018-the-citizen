The South African Police Service has condemned a vicious petrol bomb attack on the house of a police couple in the early hours of Friday in Ekangala, west of Tshwane.
Police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the couple were the only people in the house and were asleep when the house was petrol-bombed.
“A shootout ensued as shots were allegedly fired by suspects, and the husband returned fire, forcing the unknown suspects to flee,” Peters said.
.
He said the wife, a sergeant in the SAPS, sustained burn wounds and was immediately rushed to hospital.
The motive behind the attack is yet to be established.
The Gauteng provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Deliwe de Lange, expressed concern at the continued attacks against the police and said such malicious attacks were nothing less than deliberately undermining the authority of the state.
.
De Lange is also calling on members of the SAPS and other law enforcement agencies not to be deterred in their efforts at fighting crime and stamping the authority of the state.
She asked them to remember to always be safe and continue to prioritise their own safety.
“Remember, harbouring a suspect is a criminal offence. These suspects live within our communities.
“They are our neighbours, friends and/or family,” De Lange said.
.
She is appealing to members of the public who might have knowledge of the identity or whereabouts of the suspects to come forward and report to police.
