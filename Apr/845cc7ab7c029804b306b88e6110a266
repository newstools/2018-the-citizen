A lighthearted video taken by Hashtag Our SA has attempted to poke a bit of fun at former president Jacob Zuma’s supporters, who came out in their numbers in Durban to support him ahead of the reopening of his corruption trial at the High Court.
In the video, one supporter likens Zuma to Jesus, while the general impression is that his fans have accepted the narrative that attempted to recast his image in the latter months of his presidency as a man promoting radical economic transformation for black South Africans in opposition to the dangers of white monopoly capital.
The general impression created by the video is that there is confusion about what Zuma is actually being charged with, with some feeling it’s because he championed the cause of poor black people. Others feel it is suspicious that Zuma was (incorrectly, true) always reported by many in the media as facing 783 charges, when in fact his charges (now confirmed as 16) always related to the 783 questionable payments he received from financial adviser Schabir Shaik.
In the video, a supporter likens his suffering to that of Jesus Christ. Other female supporters cheer loudly when asked if they’d like Zuma back for another term as president, with one saying he isn’t “choosy” about who he loves.
The clincher clearly comes at the end where one guy blames white monopoly capital, personified by billionaire Johann Rupert, for Zuma’s woes.
The supporter says “captured comrades” who’ve “infiltrated” the ANC on behalf of Zuma’s enemies “are killing us with the polony now”, a reference to the fact that processed chicken products linked to Rainbow Chicken, a company in which Rupert has a stake, was named by the department of health as possibly being a distributor of the fatal strain of listeria that caused the listeriosis outbreak in South Africa.
