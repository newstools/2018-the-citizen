“I want to take this opportunity to express regret that we find ourselves in a situation where we find ourselves in the province. It’s unfortunate — I don’t think that we should have been in this particular situation, had all parties from the onset considered some of the matters differently. and developed an approach that may have assisted us not to be where we are today,” he said after meeting with traditional leaders.
Mahumapelo met with the North West House of Traditional Leaders at Sun City near Rustenburg.
The traditional leaders had requested a meeting with Mahumapelo to discuss the current state of violence and instability in the province.
Mahumapelo said the situation could have been avoided.
“This is affecting what we had come up with as the fifth administration of the province. But as a premier of the province I see it as an opportunity. Difficult as it may be I see it as an opportunity for all sectors for all citizens to come together.”
Traditional healers said they wanted to be part of the solution to restore calm in the province.
Chairperson of the House of Traditional Leaders Kgosi Moshe Mabe said as leaders they would like to be involved in decision-making that would lead to calm being restored in the province.
The traditional leaders also wanted to meet with President Cyril Ramaphosa over the ongoing situation in North West.
Violent protests erupted in Mahikeng on April 18, with residents calling for Mahumapelo to resign. The protests spread to several parts of the province.
For the past two weeks buildings have been torched, shops looted and many foreign nationals have been displaced.
