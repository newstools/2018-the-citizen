African National Congress (ANC) elections head, Fikile Mbalula, today announced the appointment of Ebrahim Rasool as the ANC Western Cape provincial head of elections. 
“We are confident in the decision taken by the ANC. Comrade Rasool will work with a team accountable to the leadership collective of the ANC in the Western Cape and ultimately, our National ANC leadership,” Mbalula said in a statement. 
“People of the Western Cape have correctly said the [Democratic Alliance] DA has not attended to their cries. We cannot abandon our people in the face of such difficulties that have visited them. Our mandate is to win their trust and govern the Western Cape.”
In a statement the ANC said that Rasool was a long serving member of the party and has served as Western Cape premier.
“Under premier Comrade Rasool, the poor people of Western Cape came first, tangible improvements in people’s lives were evident,” ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said.
Rasool expressed gratitude at the decision taken by the ANC.
“I do not take this task lightly, The ANC’s renewal comes at the same time as the DA is imploding. For those who left the ANC, we want them come back. We are calling you for the campaign of your life,” Rasool said.
