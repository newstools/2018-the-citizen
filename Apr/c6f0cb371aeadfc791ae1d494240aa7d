The Johannesburg Metro Police Department has cautioned motorists to steer clear of the central business district as thousands of workers are expected to take part in a nationwide strike called by the South African Federation of Trade Unions.
JMPD spokesperson Edna Mamonyane said several roads would be closed to make way for an expected protest march commencing from Newtown Precinct Park.
The march is expected to move through Miriam Makeba Street in Newton and then proceed up Lilian Ngoyi Street and right into Simmonds Street, where protesters will hand over a memorandum at the office of premier of Gauteng.
Protesters will then continue on to Anderson Street and right into Pixley Ka Seme and hand over more memorandums at the chamber of mines and the department of health.
A fourth memorandum is due to be delivered to the department of labour before the marchers return to Newtown Precinct Park and disperse.
Mamonyane said JMPD officers had been deployed to monitor the marches.
“I would like to warn those people who think that they will come with criminal elements, we are ready for them. Be aware that you will face the full might of law,” she warned.
Saftu has called the march to protest a proposed national minimum wage of R20 per hour, which it says is too low.
