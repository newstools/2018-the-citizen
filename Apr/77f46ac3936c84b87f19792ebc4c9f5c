Port Elizabeth-based trainer Jacques Strydom holds a winning hand with two raiders, Desert Wisdom (Karl Zechner) and Frikkie (Craig Zackey), in Race 7, the R110,000 Northern Cape Stayers Handicap, at Flamingo Park today.
This 2200m feature event is Leg 4 of the Pick 6 which has a carryover of R100,000 and is estimated to reach R525,000.
A one-time winner in Cape Town, four-year-old Desert Wisdom has shown remarkable improvement in five runs since joining Strydom’s stable and racing exclusively over 2200m on the Polytrack at Fairview. The gelded son of Querari followed up a close second with a smart double victory. Then he was narrowly defeated by Frikkie, who gave him 0.5kg, in a MR 72 Handicap.
However, in Desert Wisdom’s next outing, teamed up with Zechner for the first time and clashing with Frikkie at level weights, he was a decisive winner of the Lakeside Handicap. Frikkie was three lengths back in third place.
It points to a win for Desert Wisdom as he is 2.5kg better off with Frikkie. But do not dismiss Frikkie, who will try to win this race for the second year running.
In the Lakeside Handicap as he checked 1000m out and lost position, but was doing his best work late. With better luck, the consistent five-year-old will be dangerous and must be included in Pick 6 and Jackpot bets.
