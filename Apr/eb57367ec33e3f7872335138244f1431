With just a few hours left till the 21st Prism Awards, excitement is in the air to see who will be victorious at what’s deemed the Oscars of the Public Relations industry.
The judges of Prism Awards, which take place on Sunday, say the quality of entries has improved through the years.
Although the awards have taken place for the past 21 years, it is only the second year that young judges have been accommodated.
Prism Young Judges was founded in 2017 by Palesa Madumo, executive director of strategy at Vuma Reputation Management. Madumo is also a judge of the awards. The aim was to create an opportunity for students, bloggers, and youth to have a voice in judging the Prism Awards.
Some of the anticipated awards are the Life Time Achiever Award, the Pan African Award, the Young Judges Award and the Campaign of The Year Awards.
Giving his perspective on the awards, Kevin Welman from By Design Communications, who was part of the Student and Consumer PR cluster in the judging process, said there was now an “over-reliance” on social media. He said traditional media needed to be used more as well as other marketing tools to get a balanced approach.
“People needed to keep in mind that they were communication entries, they must document how communication solves a business challenge,” said Welman.
Another young judge, Sithulile Mbayi, who has done a wide range of work including the production of a documentary titled Istimela which aired on SABC 1, said: “I wanted to understand what was current in the PR space, how one could use their way of thinking to boost their own PR and meet the minds behind the awards and the value they added in the industry.”
Mbayi added: “I feel the entrants could’ve done more justice to their entries if they focused more on the business side and strategy towards their projects”.
The Prism Awards will be held at the Empire Conference and Events Venue in Parktown.
