Journalist Masego Seemela visited the Fourways Memorial Park earlier this week.
The photos she tweeted were of the site where the general manager of the park said Winnie Madikizela-Mandela would be laid to rest next to her great-granddaughter Zenani Mandela, who was buried there in 2010.
Here are the photos she took:


The Abathembu royal family had wanted the struggle icon to be buried in the Eastern Cape, king Azenathi Dalindyebo told the capacity crowd at her funeral at Orlando Stadium in Soweto, Johannesburg, on Saturday.
“We had wished she would be buried next to Madiba in Qunu … but we understand the family’s decision to bury her here … she cannot not be boxed in life and death,” he told 40 000 mourners at the stadium, adding that the Xhosa culture did not recognise divorce.
Madikizela-Mandela died at the age of 81 on April 2 at Johannesburg’s Milpark Hospital.
The funeral procession arrived at the cemetery at about 4pm.
