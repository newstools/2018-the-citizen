The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa’s (Icasa) new decision to end the frustration of losing unused data after 30 days has opened a new door of hope to data users.
Icasa made the announcement on Thursday and said the new regulation was that users were now allowed to keep unused data so long as they remained active on the network.
Service providers now must notify users when their data falls under 50%, 80% and 100%.
Users will now be allowed to carry over unused data to the next month. All licensees will be required to provide this option.
It expects all network providers to allow consumers to transfer data to other users on the same network.
Service providers will no longer be allowed to charge consumers out-of-bundle rates when data has run out without the consumers’ specific prior consent.
This has been well-received by tweeps in Twitterville, who welcome the judgment.
