Take a look at the video below:

It turns out the man in question owns a memorial business, which has done tombstones for celebs such as Nelson Mandela, Baby Jake Matlala and Mandoza. They have also designed and manufactured statues of Thabo Mbeki, Cristiano Ronaldo, Bishop Tutu and others.
Business must be good for Khitsane!
The gesture has divided social media since the video went viral yesterday.
