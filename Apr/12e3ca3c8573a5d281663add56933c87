A disturbing video of traffic on the N1 to Polokwane has gone viral on social media, the Review Online reports.
The video, posted on Facebook by user Marno Bam shows traffic snaking on the N1 with motorists driving into oncoming traffic, turning what is meant to be a double-lane highway into a triple lane.


The department of transport says they are still expecting high volumes of traffic over Easter weekend.
The video, posted on Thursday has been massively viewed already.
