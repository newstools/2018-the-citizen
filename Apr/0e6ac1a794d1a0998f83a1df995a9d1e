A group of Australian tourists vowed never to return to the Kruger National Park after encountering protesters hindering their visit, Letaba Herald reports.
The Paul Kruger, Phabeni and Numbi gates were inaccessible due to service-delivery protests that took place on the R536 and R538 earlier this week.
Col Mtsholi Bhembe said the police swept through the area on Tuesday, and in the process arrested 23 protesters for public violence. SANParks’ Rey Thakuli said all gates were open by the time of going to press on Wednesday.
The protests caused havoc among tour operators, who had to explain to expectant international tourists that these roads were closed because of the adjacent community having blockaded it with burning tyres and rubble.
Guests and tour operators alike were advised to use alternative routes such as the Malelane or Orpen gates, which for some, caused a massive loss in business.
“The tourists were in a state of shock and panic. We were forced to cancel the trip and refund the customers. On the same day, with a bitter taste in their mouths, they left the Lowveld and took a plane to Cape Town. After an hour waiting it out at Mugg & Bean in Hazyview, we cancelled the trip and they vowed never to return,” said Hennie Bekker, co-owner of Private Kruger Safaris.
