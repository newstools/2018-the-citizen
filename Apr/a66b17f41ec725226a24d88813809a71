Yet another clip of EFF leader Julius Malema dishing out soundbites in the wake of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s death has been trending on social networks this week, this time in relation to long-running allegations that ANC Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini appears in public inebriated.
However, many have countered that her demeanour is simply that of someone who generally always looks and sounds like a somewhat angry drunkard. She herself has strongly denied that she ever touches alcohol, and the rumours of her drinking once upset her spokesperson, Lumka Oliphant, so much that she wrote an angry Facebook post about it in which Oliphant swore repeatedly and said that if it were up to Dlamini, there would be no drinking or alcohol advertising in South Africa.
She controversially added: “…don’t talk s**t about her. Just know that from today on, I have decided to take this alcohol matter to the gutter where you have taken it.”

However, Malema has continued to dig at this sore point, referencing both Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Dlamini by claiming that neither of them will be able to live up to the high standards that Mama Winnie set by herself once having been the president of the women’s league.
“Nkosazana Zuma will never be Mother of the Nation. Bathabile Dlamini … maybe her title will be Drunkard of the Nation.”
While some on Twitter found the insult hilarious, others thought he was being unnecessarily disrespectful.
Watch the clip below, which comes from an EFF rally on Friday last week:
