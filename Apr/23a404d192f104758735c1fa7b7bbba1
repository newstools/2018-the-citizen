The Hawks are reportedly investigating a case of fraud and corruption against former president Jacob Zuma and embattled North West premier Supra Mahumapelo over a herd of cattle worth R1.5 million Mahumapelo allegedly gifted Zuma using public funds.
The Sunday Times reports that the cattle, 24 cows and a bull, that were delivered to Nkandla in October 2016 were intended to be given to emerging farmers in North West. The delivery of the cows was apparently signed for by Zuma himself.
Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed to the paper that the priority crime unit was investigating the scandal, but could not divulge any further details on the ongoing probe.
The delivery of the cows was confirmed to Sunday Times by Lucas Msiza, who is said to be the breeder of the cattle. Msiza told the paper that he was contracted by a company called AgriDelight to deliver “his best cattle to Zuma”.
“I got an order for 25 Bonsmara cattle from my client, AgriDelight, and I was given a delivery address which happened to be Nkandla, the former president’s private residence, where I must deliver them,” Msiza was quoted as saying.
AgriDelight reportedly has a R56 million, three-year contract with the North West rural, environmental and agriculture department as an implementing agent to — among other things — assist poor farmers in the province.
