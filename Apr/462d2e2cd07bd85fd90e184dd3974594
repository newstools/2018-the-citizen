The emotional and sometimes inflammatory rhetoric of politicians on land redistribution obscures the fact that this is far from being a simple, binary issue. Like many problems in this country and on this continent, the truth lies not in black or white – and we don’t mean race – but in the subtle shades of grey. 
So, there will never be the simple solution of taking land away from whites and giving it to blacks. 
The complexities of land were highlighted this week by the Khoi San Land Summit, called by descendants of the people who can be regarded as the first people of South Africa. 
They were here before white settlers arrived – starting in the Cape in 1652 – and before the migrations of African people came south. 
Elain Appies, of the Griqua Royal House, complained that the government had not dealt adequately with the issue of land rights of the Khoi and the San. 
The summit itself became mired in controversy when people began questioning the involvement of minority rights lobby group AfriForum, which has been supporting the Khoisan lobbying with the government over land. 
It does seem as though this is political opportunism on the part of AfriForum, with critics saying their support of the Khoisan is part of their overall plan to derail any land expropriation without compensation. There is also valid concern that the AfriForum tactic will “divide and rule” the various nonwhite groups. 
However, the issue of the Khoi and San cannot simply be wished away. Not only do they have a special case, but their situation confronts SA with uncomfortable questions – like who, exactly, is an African?; who, exactly, is a settler; and who took what from whom? 
Land redistribution is inevitable, but it must be only done after thorough research and consultation.
