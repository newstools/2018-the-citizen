If developments from the Democratic Alliance’s federal congress in Tshwane this weekend are to be believed, then the opposition party appear to be unified as they look to take on the ANC in next year’s general elections.
Mmusi Maimane was re-elected as the leader, while Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip was re-elected as federal chair and James Selfe as the federal council chair. Michael Waters, Ivan Meyer and Refiloe Ntsekhe are the three deputy federal chairpersons.
Maimane was nominated unopposed and will lead the DA for another three years, while Trollip beat out Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga to the position in a fiercely contested battle.
The DA needs to put up a united front after being criticised in recent times, particularly with the ongoing Patricia de Lille spat.
The De Lille battle with the DA is especially interesting as the opposition party this weekend put new policies in place that could have a direct bearing on her. Delegates agreed to amend the party’s constitution yesterday, giving the DA powers to recall elected public representatives from office.
In the case of mayors, premiers, presidents or any other public DA representative who have lost the confidence of their caucus, they are required to resign within 48 hours after making representations to the DA federal executive.
De Lille is fighting to clear her name within the party after being accused of corruption and maladministration. “It’s going to be the most important election we’ve ever had as a party … forward DA, forward,” Maimane said.
“We have a big job ahead of us next year. We will begin the task of sharing with the people of South Africa a hope that is better than today.
“Many people are disappointed, saying ‘Look, the DA is divided.’ Look around, this is one South Africa,” added Maimane.
Confident words indeed.
