Nother Russia, who almost caused the upset of the day at Turffontein on Saturday, is among the 13 entries for the R1-million HSH Princess Charlene Empress Club Stakes over 1600m on Saturday 21 April.



Mike de Kock’s charge got within a neck of 4-10 favourite Legal Eagle in the Grade 1 HF Oppenheimer Horse Chestnut Stakes over 1600m, a distance over which Sean Tarry’s charge is now unbeaten in nine starts.
De Kock has entered four runners in this Grade 1 race, the others being Orchid Island, Cascapedia and three-year-old Fish River. Assistant trainer Mathew de Kock said prior to the running of the Horse Chestnut Stakes that there is a possibility Orchid Island may miss the Empress Club Stakes and go for the R4-million President‘s Champion Challenge over 2000m at Turffontein on 5 May.
The main mission for Nother Russia is the Empress Club Stakes and after her superb run to Legal Eagle on Saturday she will have many supporters.
Cascapedia had to be withdrawn for the Sun Met at Kenilworth in Cape Town after taking ill. She had to be given some time off but returned to work early in March.
Fish River started favourite for the Wilgerbosdrift Gauteng Fillies Guineas over 1600m in March but failed to make a mark on the race which saw both her stable companions, Takingthepeace and Silver Thursday finish first andsecond respectively.



 Silvan Star was an impressive winner at the Vaal a few weeks back and Glen Kotzen’s charge is another who will have strong claims to win this race. Second to her on that occasion was Justin Snaith-trained Gimme Six who is expected to come on from her last run.
Tarry has entered four runners – Heaps Of Fun, Safe Harbour, Simply Royal and Tahini while Geoff Woodruff has nominated Al Danza, a gutsy winner of the Listed Jacaranda Handicap over 1800m at Turffontein last Satur- day, as well as BiPot.
Supplementary entries close 9am on Monday 16 April with declarations at 11am the following day, Tuesday 17 April.
The “Royal race meeting” is sure to be a major draw card. There is an entrance fee of R50 per person but children under 12 are free, while kids over 12 can come in for half price.


There will be a “diamond drop” again this year with only 1000 tickets up for sale at R150 each.
There are tables available in the Centenary room at R280 a head which includes entrance fee and a three-course buffet.
