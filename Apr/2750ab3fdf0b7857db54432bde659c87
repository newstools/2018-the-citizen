There are two ways to look at the Australian government’s travel advisory to its citizens that, should they want to travel to South Africa, they need to “exercise a high degree of caution”. 
The advice doesn’t quite amount to warning people against coming here, but the SA government has, nevertheless, accused the Australians of spreading “misleading” information about the country, which could not only discourage visitors, but also harm SA’s image internationally. 
The Aussies are being extreme in their assessments – especially when they warn that SA could be a site for terrorism. 
Many other countries – and not SA – have been victims of this international scourge. 
Many tourists have a wonderful, safe, time here. 
However, it is worrying that people abroad have a low opinion of SA – and there is some basis for those views. 
Crime levels are high, road safety is appalling and government services in some areas leave much to be desired. 
The Aussies are definitely offside with their comments – but SA should also be honest and, as a government and as citizens, start to tackle those bad areas of society which disturb others. 
That also will benefit the SA tourism industry – and all the people, too.
