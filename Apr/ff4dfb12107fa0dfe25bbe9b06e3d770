International private healthcare services group Mediclinic said on Wednesday it expected to deliver adjusted financial results marginally ahead of expectations, with a significant second half improvement from the Middle East division.
“‘We are succeeding with the turnaround of the Abu Dhabi business and laying the foundation for long-term, sustainable performance,” CEO Danie Meintjes said.
“The Middle East division is now entering an expansionary phase that we expect will drive a strong increase in revenue and improvement in margins over time.”
