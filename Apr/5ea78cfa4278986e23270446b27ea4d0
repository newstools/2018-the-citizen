ANC top guns have held urgent talks with concerned members opposed to North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo as pressure mounts for him to resign. 
The ANC leadership, led by secretary-general Ace Magashule, met with his opponents yesterday to discuss their plan to support an EFF-sponsored motion of no confidence in Mahumapelo. 
Residents in Mafikeng also staged protests demanding his resignation over the alleged failure of his government to deliver public services since he came to power. 
A bus was torched and several vehicles damaged when protesters hurled stones and barricaded streets with burning tyres in Mafikeng, demanding Mahumapelo resign. 
They also accused Mahumapelo, who is ANC provincial chairperson, of corruption and being behind the divisions among members in the province. 
“Mafikeng is on fire. The protests are spreading to surrounding areas,” said a resident who spoke anonymously via telephone. 
Senior ANC and Tripartite Alliance members had expressed concern about corruption under Mahumapelo. 
Recently the premier’s office and that of the provincial director-general, Lydia Sebego, were raided by the Hawks on suspicion of their involvement in corrupt activities. 
The protests came as senior party members met yesterday to discuss Mahumapelo’s fate, with some gunning for his head. Some MPLs expressed willingness to support the motion of no confidence. 
The motion was postponed on Tuesday to allow the EFF to obtain an interdict against the speaker. The party said they sought for the court to interdict speaker Suzan Dantjie, to ensure that she opted for a secret ballot instead of an open ballot. 
EFF MPL and party provincial leader Betty Diale told The Citizen yesterday: “We are seeking clarity about the secret ballot. If we get the secret ballot, trust me, Supra is gone.”
