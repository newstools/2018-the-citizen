South African billionaire Christo Wiese on Thursday lodged a R59-billion claim against Steinhoff International Holdings in respect to cash investments made by his Titan Group of companies in Steinhoff in 2015 and 2016.
Wiese lost billions of rand in investment when the Steinhoff share price crashed last year due to the “accounting irregularities” scandal which also ended the career of its long-time chief executive, Markus Joostè, and prompting Wiese’s resignation as chairman.
Wiese’s companies are claiming for repayment of the subscription amount they paid in 2015 when they subscribed for shares in Steinhoff following the acquisition of Pepkor Limited.
The second claim relates to the Titan Group’s capital injection into Steinhoff in 2016 to enable it to meet its debt obligations at the time of its acquisition of Mattress Firm in the US.
In a letter accompanying the summons, Wiese’s attorneys stated that he believed it is in the best interest of all stakeholders in Steinhoff that a restructuring of the group be effected on fair and equitable terms.
Wiese said in his view the Steinhoff group owned some excellent businesses, most of which Steinhoff acquired from Pepkor in 2015, and that they “have every potential of continuing to create value for all shareholders and claimants”.
“Many of the other business in the Steinhoff group offer good prospects and I strongly believe every attempt possible should be made to restructure the group as expeditiously as possible,” Wiese said.
Wiese further said his group was fully prepared to work with other claimants and shareholders to ensure that Steinhoff remains and continues as a sustainable company. This would require a restructuring of its current debt.
This prospect is based on the continued excellent performance of the Steinhoff Africa Retail (STAR) group, which contains most of the original Pepkor businesses, and of which Steinhoff is currently the controlling shareholder.
