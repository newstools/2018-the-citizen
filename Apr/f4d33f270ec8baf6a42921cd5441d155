Workers across the country’s major cities, including Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, are gathering at their respective assembly points for the nationwide South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) strike today.


The union is marching against the national minimum wage and proposed amendments to the labour law, which include that unions should ballot their members before embarking on strike action.


Saftu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi has said violence will not be tolerated during the strike and that no worker who chooses not to take part in the protest action will be intimidated.
SAPS has warned that no criminal behaviour will be tolerated during the marches around the country.
Some Saftu members marched with interesting placards depicting President Cyril Ramaphosa with buffalo horns, a reference to the president’s R18-million bid for buffalo several years ago.




Here are more scenes from the march across the country:
