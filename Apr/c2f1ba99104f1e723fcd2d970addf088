ANC chairperson Gwede Mantashe expressed his sadness during Madikizela-Mandela’s tribute, adding people should celebrate the struggle stalwart.
Emphasising that she was an all-round great ANC leader, Mantashe noted that Madikizela-Mandela was a leader of the people.
“We are sending off a friend of the working class and the poor. We are sending off a leader who will be known in every informal settlement in our country,” said Mantashe.
Mantashe highlighted the importance of uniting the ANC. “Mama Albertina Sisulu and Mama Winnie were mothers, but they never walked in the shadows of their husbands. They were leaders in their own right,” he said
Mantashe added people should celebrate her life and legacy. “She was in every structure of young people. It is important for us to pay that tribute and pay our respect,” said Mantashe.
