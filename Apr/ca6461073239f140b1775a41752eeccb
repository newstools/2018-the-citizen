An educational initiative to raise awareness of human trafficking among children has been launched in Richards Bay, and those behind it look forward to the impact it will have, Zululand Observer reports.
Freedom Generation, in partnership with UNISA, last week launched its School for Superheroes colouring book.

The 12-page illustrated story and colouring book takes the child through the adventures of two superheroes, Frankie and Geena.
Throughout the book, children will identify with Frankie and Geena, aspiring to be like them.
At the end, they will receive a certificate once they have completed the School for Superheroes.
The book was designed as an educational tool, to be completed by the children in a classroom environment and facilitated by teachers.
“It was designed to be used in curriculum format as an educational tool because if it is not, the book will not get through to the children’s understanding,” said Caroline Pitout of Freedom Generation
Parents and teachers must use their discretion as to how much human trafficking information or detail they give the children, bearing in mind that the idea is to educate children to protect them, not to scare them.
Recently launched in Gauteng, the children completed all the lessons in the book over a five-week period.
“This book is not a normal colouring-in book that is finished in a day. It must be done consistently and not rushed in order for the child to gain the understanding.”
The book equips children with the tools to fight human trafficking should they ever be exposed to it.
It teaches them that talking to someone they love is their weapon against people trying to harm them.
