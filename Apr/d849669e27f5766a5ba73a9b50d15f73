South Africa’s parliament said on Friday the institution was processing legislation that will regulate and require public disclosure of private funds received by political parties represented in parliament and provincial legislatures.
This is to enhance greater openness, accountability and transparency, Parliament said in a statement marking Freedom Day, the day on which South Africa commemorates the first democratic elections which took place in 1994.
As part of their Freedom Day message, parliament is also preparing to review the law governing the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid).
“This is to enable greater parliamentary oversight over the powers of the Minister of Police to remove or discipline the Ipid Executive Director,” the statement read.
To ensure that democracy makes a meaningful improvement to the lives of the people, parliament appointed an independent panel to assess the impact of legislation passed since 1994.
“The high level panel has made fundamental and progressive recommendations to intensify the programme of socio-economic transformation,” said the statement.
