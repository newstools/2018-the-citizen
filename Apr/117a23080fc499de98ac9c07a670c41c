The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has warned beachgoers and sea-users to exercise caution as the full moon spring tide peaks around the coast on Monday.
“NSRI urge bathers, anglers, and people walking along the shoreline to be aware of spring tide and to exercise caution,” the institute said in a statement on Sunday.
Spring tide caused a coastal higher than normal high tide, a lower than normal low tide, and stronger than normal rip currents.
“Spring tide happens during the full moon and during the new moon, and lasts for a few days leading up to the full (or new) moon, peaks on the day of full (or new) moon, and lasts for a few days after the full (or new) moon.
“This full moon spring tide peaks on Monday, 30th April, and coastal users are urged to be cautious around the coastline,” the NSRI said.
