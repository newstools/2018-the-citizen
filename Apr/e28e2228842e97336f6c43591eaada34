Absa’s services were offline on Wednesday morning, preventing clients from making payments and withdrawals, Rekord Centurion reports.
Many of the bank’s frustrated clients vented their frustrations on Twitter.
The bank responded to clients on Twitter, saying it was experiencing technical difficulties with the banking app and online banking channels.
“We are currently experiencing technical challenges with our Banking App and Online Banking channels. Our team is working on a fix and your patience is appreciated. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience this may cause. We thank you for your understanding and support,” the tweet read.
As expected, many people were not in a forgiving mode given that the 25th is payday for many across the country.
“Absa online banking services are down. On payday. Surely one of the most predictable load patterns. Time to move to the cloud,” tweeted Bevan Andries.
A tweet from Alecia Lombard read: “People! It’s payday!! We need to get bills settled! What the hell?? Is it my imagination or is this starting to occur more often…?”




At 11am on Wednesday, Absa’s apps were still not accessible.
