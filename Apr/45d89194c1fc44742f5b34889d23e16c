Police in Limpopo have made a major breakthrough in the brutal killing of two people in Mashashane, outside Polokwane, with the arrest of three suspects on Tuesday night, 10 April, Bosveld Review reports.
According to police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, a dedicated team of investigators have been on the case since February, following the chilling discovery of Mapula Veronica Mahanyele’s (47) body from Ga-Matlala Phofu, as well as charred remains of an unknown person, which was found inside Mahanyele’s burnt vehicle.

“Three suspects, between the ages of 19 and 22-years-old, were finally cornered in Kallspruit village in the Seshego policing area. During the arrest some of the items believed to be belonging to the deceased were recovered,” Mojapelo added.
Mahanyele was reported missing on February 5, after her distraught family discovered she did not report to work or home.
Police investigations ensued, which led to the charred remains of the only occupant found inside a burnt car in the bushes on 6 February.
“Police investigations uncovered that the suspects are also linked to another car-hijacking and a rape case, which took place in Mashashane on 28 March. During the commission of these criminal acts, it was discovered that the suspects were out on a bail for car-hijacking which occurred around the Seshego area,” Mojapelo said.
The incident leading to the death of the body found inside the vehicle is still being investigated, and the identity of the deceased will be determined upon receipt of DNA results, which will be released as soon as the family has been notified.
The suspects are expected to appear before the Seshego Magistrates’ Court soon on charges of murder, rape, kidnapping, robbery and carjacking.
