Jacob Zuma had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, from the office of president of South Africa. It appears that his acolyte in the North West province, Premier Supra Mahumapelo, is doing the same.
Even as the smoke from protest fires was still dispersing over the weekend, Mahumapelo and his allies – in the ANC Women’s League and ANC Youth League – were digging in to resist the demand of rioters in Mahikeng and elsewhere that he be removed as premier.
Mahumapelo says, quite correctly, that the demonstrations are politically motivated. The people don’t want you there, sir, and your business is politics. However, whether there is an organised hand behind the riots – perhaps involving those supporting President Cyril Ramaphosa – remains to be seen.
There are multiple accusations of corruption involving Mahumapelo, the latest outlined in newspaper reports yesterday that he had used taxpayers’ money to give Zuma a gift of cows for his Nkandla compound.
Mahumapelo’s excuse for most of what he is accused of is the tired, old “it was officials, not me” also used by former Free State premier Ace Magashule to dodge his own corruption bullets.
We’ve all had enough of you. Go now.
