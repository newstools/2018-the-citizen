Police are yet to make arrests regarding a multimillion-rand Soweto drug lab that was found in Orlando West on Wednesday this week.
Police national commissioner General Khehla Sithole speaking on 702 said “they” were “hot on the heels” of the culprits and arrests would be made soon.
The house was found on Wednesday, and police were combing the crime scene for more information.
The Hawks, alongside police, are confident arrests will be made as they continue to process findings with the goal of connecting the suspects to the crime scene.

Admitting that communities had lost confidence in police, Sithole said one of their priorities was to reinstate confidence by gaining public confidence.
“There will be a special task team assigned to target syndicates,” he said, which should be launched in the coming week.
Police are taking syndicates and drug kingpins head on, says Sithole, who confirmed the house was used as a drug plant.
He added strategies to improve relationships with community members would also be implemented in the journey of regaining public confidence.

The lab in Orlando West harboured drug peddlers, employers alongside their employees, and Sithole is adamant that the bust was a solid step in the right direction.
The list of suspects appears to be massive according to Sithole, which should produce arrests “soon”.
Kilos in drugs in packages and equipment were found inside the hollow abandoned house on Wednesday, but no one was at the property.
Tablets, powder and unidentified solution will be keeping the Hawks and police busy as they quantify the estimated street value of the find, which will be disclosed once all information is tallied, according to police.
