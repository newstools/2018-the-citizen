A Twitter user became briefly famous on “Black Twitter” on Monday for a well-meant post that came out all wrong.
He’s since deleted it, though it would have been a lot more fun if he hadn’t.
DA leader Mmusi Maimane took to Twitter on Monday to upload a picture of himself with him mum, and captioned it: “Dumelang Bagaetsho [Greetings brethren]. Today ke birthday ya ma OuLady [It’s my Old Lady’s birthday today]. She is an incredible person from whom I draw inspiration and courage. Happy Birthday Mama. Ka lerato [With love].”
A user called “Vaughan” then tweeted his birthday wishes to “Dumelang”, clearly not knowing that this is just a Setswana greeting. He wished her an awesome day.

For the record, Maimane’s mother’s name is Ethel Maimane.
Some on Twitter weren’t happy that Vaughan had spoiled the fun by deleting his tweet.


A perusal of Vaughan’s timeline suggests he is a big DA fan, retweeting positive stories about the party, along with other political articles. The EFF and ANC content he retweets, though, is somewhat less flattering to those organisations.
