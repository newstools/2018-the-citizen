The EFF says it has written to public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane requesting her to investigate newspaper reports that North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo gave former president Jacob Zuma a herd of cattle worth R1.5 million as a gift using public funds.
The Sunday Times reported on Sunday that the Hawks are investigating a case of fraud and corruption against Zuma and the embattled premier over the allegations.
According to the paper, the cows that were delivered to Nkandla in October 2016 were intended to be given to emerging farmers in North West.
“Both Mahumapelo and Zuma must be investigated and if found guilty they must not only pay back the money, they must be criminally held liable for abuse of state funds. It is not possible that Zuma can claim that he wrongly benefited from state money without any knowledge as it was the case with the Nkandla homestead security upgrades,” EFF national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said in a statement.
“This time, the Public Protector must not only recover public funds wrongly used for the private benefit of Zuma but must charge relevant law enforcement agencies to prosecute Zuma and Mahumapelo for stealing state cattle,” Ndlozi added.
The red berets also reiterated their call for Mahumapelo to step down as North West premier after the province’s capital, Mahikeng, and surrounding villages was rocked by violent protests by residents this week calling for Mahumapelo to step down.
“Mahumapelo has not only failed to drive the state machinery to deliver services, he has been part of crippling corruption,” Ndlozi said.
On Saturday, the situation was relatively calm in Mahikeng despite two attempts to burn buildings overnight, North West police said.
