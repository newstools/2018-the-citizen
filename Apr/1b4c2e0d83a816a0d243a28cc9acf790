Embattled business executive Mark Lamberti today resigned from the Board of Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA).
Lamberti is the chief executive of Imperial Holdings, a group of logistics and automotive companies. He is the BLSA’s longest serving director and has a strong track record of contribution both to the various businesses he has led and to the country.
Last week, he resigned from his position as a director on the Eskom board following judgement by the North Gauteng which found him guilty of discrimination after he referred to an employee as a female employment equity candidate. Lamberti later apologised for the transgression.
In a statement, BLSA said that its members were committed to playing their part in creating a South Africa of increasing prosperity for all and to delivering economic growth, transformation and inclusion, amongst others, by encouraging and empowering senior black leadership.
BLSA is an organisation of influential business people tasked with promoting investment in the country.
“Against this context, and following the recent high court judgment on the merits in favour of Ms Adila Chowan and against Associated Motor Holdings, Imperial Holdings and himself, the BLSA board appreciates Mr Lamberti’s apology,” it said.
“BLSA also appreciates the commitment provided by Mr Lamberti and the Imperial Board to accelerate the Imperial Group’s transformation initiatives of recent years.”
BLSA said that its members would take important lessons from the incident on how to better manage transformation in the vital interests of the country.
