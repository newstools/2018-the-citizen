The African National Congress in KwaZulu-Natal has added its voice to those condemning the outbreak of violence that followed Kaizer Chiefs’ 2-0 loss to Free State Stars in the Nedbank Cup semi-final at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday night.
“In an ugly advert for South African football, the soccer game turned into a war zone as violence erupted forcing players and technical staff of Kaizer Chiefs to run for cover, resulting in the destruction of stadium infrastructure and vehicles outside the stadium,” the ANC said in a statement.
“The outrageous acts of hooliganism and reckless violence led by supporters of Kaizer Chiefs leaves a bitter taste in our football fraternity in our country. The unforeseen drubbing of the Kaizer Chiefs allegedly sparked rage among the supporters who also resorted to pitch invasion shortly after the game finished.
“Sport is ultimately about winning and losing and as such it requires a certain level of maturity from supporters of competing sports teams. Violence does not come into this at any point. All legitimate disputes should be resolved through institutional channels,” ANC KwaZulu-Natal provincial interim committee co-ordinator Zihle Zikalala said.
