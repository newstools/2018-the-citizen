At the DA’s elective conference on Sunday in Tshwane, a proposed amendment to the party’s constitution to allow for a deputy leader was rejected.
Prominent DA MP Natasha was one of those who were standing for the position, but she cannot be elected now.
Other proposed amendments to the constitution have also fared badly this weekend, with a change to put in place quotas for racial transformation in the party also rejected on Saturday.
However, a move to increase branch representation from 35% to 45% was accepted by the congress on Sunday morning.
More than 1700 delegates at the Democratic Alliance’s federal congress under way at the Tshwane Events Centre in Pretoria concluded voting for new leadership on Sunday morning.
The position of DA federal chairperson was being contested by Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga, Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip, and DA Free State chairperson Annelie Lotriet. Trollip is the incumbent.
Two positions – that of party leader Mmusi Maimane and federal executive chairman James Selfe – will not be contested during the federal congress.
The results are expected to be announced on Sunday afternoon. The newly elected leadership will lead the party to the national and provincial elections next year.
