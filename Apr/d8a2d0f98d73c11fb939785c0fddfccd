Following the arrest of South African businessman Justin van Pletzen, who was detained in Dubai after circulating a video of his encounter with Ajay Gupta earlier this month, a source told News24 that it was Gupta who opened a case of invasion of privacy against Van Pletzen.
The source is reported as saying Van Pletzen is still in custody, and is set to appear in court on Monday.
Following reports of the businessman’s release, on Thursday the department of international relations and cooperation (Dirco) said it was unaware of Van Pletzen’s release.
The department’s spokesperson, Ndivhuwo Mabaya, said on Thursday: “He has not been to court. It is only in court that we will find out what he is being charged with.
“It is not like in South Africa where you know [before the accused appears in court].
“In some countries a person only knows what the charges are once they get to court,” said Mabaya.
However, he confirmed that the South African ambassador in Dubai had visited Van Pletzen in custody on Tuesday.
When Van Pletzen confronted Gupta, he had asked the fugitive when he would return to South Africa to answer to state capture allegations.
Gupta’s reply was that he would cooperate with law enforcement agencies once they “give him a reply”.
“They’re not giving a reply. The day they give a reply, I’ll go there,” Ajay said at the time.
Van Pletzen later said he was so incensed at the sight of Gupta that he wanted to hit him, but was worried about what the authorities might do to him if he did.
Acting Hawks head Yolisa Matakata announced in February a warrant of arrest for Gupta had been issued related to corruption.
