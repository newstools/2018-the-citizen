Retail group Shoprite Holdings said on Thursday its chief financial officer Marius Bosman would retire in July after more than 25 years with the company.
It said Anton de Bruyn, a qualified chartered accountant with more than 15 years’ service within the Shoprite group, most recently in the capacity of deputy general manager group finance, would replace Bosman.
“Mr de Bruyn will act as CFO designate for the next three months and will be appointed as an executive director effective 2 July 2018,” Shoprite said.
