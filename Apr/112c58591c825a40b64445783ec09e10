There will be further engagements on the fate of North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced after a long meeting on Friday, while calling for calm in protest-stricken areas.
He assured residents of Mahikeng and the greater North West that government and ANC officials are working with urgency to resolve the issues they had raised, EWN reports.
Ramaphosa says more engagement will allow them to “have all the information that will empower us to take a decision going forward”.
The president cut short his trip to the United Kingdom to come and try find solutions to the Mahikeng protests.
ANC top leaders had earlier been locked up in a meeting for hours with provincial leaders, the SACP and Cosatu.
This is as residents of Mahikeng and other towns continue with protests, accusing the premier of corruption and calling for his resignation.
