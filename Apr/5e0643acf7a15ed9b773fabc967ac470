“Many will remember Sekgapane as a fearless fighter. He is one of the best boxers who made a name for himself during the 1970s and 1980s. Bokone Bophirima [North West] has lost a giant that made the province to shine. Our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends during this difficult time,” Mahumapelo said.
The former SA lightweight and junior welterweight champion died on April 4 at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, Soweto in Johannesburg after a long illness. He was 70.
He made a name for himself during the 1970s. He retired in 1981 with a record of 51 wins, 21 of which came inside the distance. He had 15 losses and two draws.
A memorial service is scheduled for April 12 and the funeral service on April 14 at Makgokoane near Ramatlabama.
