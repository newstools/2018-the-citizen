Winnie Madikizela-Mandela died a “perfect death” because she never sold out, said EFF leader Julius Malema.
Speaking during his tribute to his friend at Orlando Stadium, Malema riled up an adoring crowd. The politician called out all of those he accused of having betrayed her.
“I am here to invoke the spirit of the one who put the country first above her own personal safety,” Malema said.
He referred to EFF members as Madikizela-Mandela’s sons and daughters.
A resounding cheer reverberated throughout the stadium as Malema, who was known as a close friend of Madikizela-Mandela, took to the podium.
He remarked that those who had sold out and abandoned Madikizela-Mandela were among the crowd. He referred to them as the UDF (United Democratic Front) cabal.
Malema said he did not know how to greet those who had “betrayed” her, pointing them out in the crowd.
“All those who resigned from the [ANC] Women’s League NEC because they said they didn’t want to be led by a criminal, they are here,” he said.
He ended his speech by demanding that the Cape Town International Airport be named after the stalwart.
