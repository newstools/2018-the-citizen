The ANC’s provincial elective conference in KwaZulu-Natal has been postponed indefinitely.
The ANC’s provincial interim committee convener, Mike Mabuyakhulu, has told eNCA the cancellation is due to unforeseen circumstances.
The elective conference became a necessity after the election of the provincial executive committee was nullified in court in September last year.
The region is allegedly divided into factions, with at least one of them supporting minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and another standing behind President Cyril Ramaphosa.
Yesterday a meeting of the party’s Moses Mabhida region descended into chaos, with video footage showing bodyguards drawing guns on party members.
