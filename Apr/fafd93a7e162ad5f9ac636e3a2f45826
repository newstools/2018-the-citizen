Convicted racist Vicky Momberg trended yet again on social media on Wednesday afternoon – this time for her particular taste in hairdo.
The former real estate agent appeared in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court with cornrows ahead of her application for leave to appeal. The matter was postponed to April 11.
Twitter exploded with mixed reactions regarding the particular choice in hairdo which is commonly associated with African women.


The 49-year-old has been found guilty of racial slurs she bandied about in November last year and has been sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, of which one year was suspended.
