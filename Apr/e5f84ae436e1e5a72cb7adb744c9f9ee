New trainer on the block Ashley Fortune aims to start her career with a bang. The wife of former champion jockey Andrew Fortune has registered her first official race entry in no less an event than the Grade 1 SA Derby to be run at Turffontein on Champions’ Day, May 5.
Fortune has nominated Cash Time, a three-time winner from six starts, for the R2-million 2450m marathon test for three-year-olds the third leg of the Triple Crown, which will not be won this year.
Cash Time, a Gimmethegreenlight gelding part owned by husband Andrew, was previously trained by Gary Alexander and reeled off two impressive wins over 2000m before tackling the 1600m Gauteng Guineas, memorably won by Monks Hood. That distance might have been too sharp as, next up, over 2000m in the Derby Trial, he was involved in a three-way battle to the line with Gambado and Forafewdollarsmore, finishing third a mere 0.20 lengths back.
Both horses that beat him there are also among the Derby “possibles”. He might have the staying ability to turn that around, but his draw of 13 out of 14 as opposed to their 7 and 8 might even things out again.
When entries for the SA Derby closed yesterday, big race maestro Mike de Kock had put forward three names – Like A Panther, Noble Secret and Royal Crusade all of whom have run promisingly in top company. The latter two have prime draws, but Like A Panther got the short straw at 14.



De Kock’s keen rival Sean Tarry also has three in: Silver God, Forafewdollarsmore and Throng. They are drawn in midfield and with the champion trainer in such hot form of late no one will be writing any of them off.
With a merit rating of 110, Surcharge, second in the first two legs of the Triple Crown to Monks Hood and Lobo’s Legend is the highest-rated potential runner. However, a draw of 10 might prompt trainer Stuart Pe igrew to give this one a miss.
Entries also closed yesterday for the Grade 1 R1-million Computaform Sprint, also to be run on Champions Day.
Topping the rankings for the 1000m dash up the straight is Justin Snaith’s speedball Sergeant Hardy, victor in the Cape Flying Championship in January. The top Cape trainer has also entered Bishop’s Bounty, giving him a formidable two-pronged attack.


Another potential Cape raider is Live Life from the Candice Bass- Robinson yard.
Others catching the eye include Rocky Valley, Champagne Haze, Trip To Heaven and Attenborough, a foursome who made up the Quartet in their 1000m warm-up race at Turffontein on Tuesday night. Naafer, last in the same race and badly in need of the run, is De Kock’s sole entry for the Computaform Sprint.
