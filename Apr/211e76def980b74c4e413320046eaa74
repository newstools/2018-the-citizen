The Brits Magistrate’s Court issued a warrant of arrest  for one of the men accused of plotting to kill  Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) members after he failed to appear in court on Thursday.
He was supposed to appear together with Nkosinathi Mantashe, Zithobile Mangqo and Bongile Cingo.
Mantashe was granted R10000 bail, while Zithobile Mangqo and Bongile Cingo were released on warning. They are facing charges of conspiracy to murder and attempted murder. The case against them was postponed to May 11 for Mkhutshwa to be present in court.
