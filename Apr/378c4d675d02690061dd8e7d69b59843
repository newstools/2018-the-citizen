Two people have been arrested after violence that erupted at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban soon after Kaizer Chiefs lost 2 – 0 in the semi-final match of the Nedbank Cup to Free State Stars on Saturday night, which left many people injured and property damaged.
Captain Nqobile Gwala said two male suspects, aged 27 and 33, were arrested for public violence and malicious damage to property.
Police also expect to arrest more people related to the violence that saw a female security personnel severely beaten by soccer fans.
Earlier today, the PSL condemned the lawlessness that broke out at the Moses Mabhida Stadium.
The PSL said it would work closely with law enforcement agencies to ensure that those responsible for the hooliganism were subjected to judicial processes.
“The league is currently awaiting reports from all relevant role players,” the PSL said in a statement.
At the final whistle of the Nedbank Cup semifinal between hosts Kaizer Chiefs and Free State Stars, hundreds of fans invaded the pitch and the security officers were unable to cope adequately with the rampaging fans.
