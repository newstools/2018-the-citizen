Anglican Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has dismissed fake media reports claiming he died while on a visit to the United States.
“There is a false story doing the rounds today [Sunday] suggesting that Archbishop Emeritus Tutu has passed away in the United States,” his office said in a brief statement.
“The archbishop and Mrs Leah Tutu are in fact in good health and spirits at home in the Western Cape,” the statement said.
