The R1.45 billion Loftus Park Centre is finally in its first phase of operation, developers told Pretoria East Rekord.
The project was conceptualised in 2013, but construction began only in 2016 while the first stage of operation began last month.

It is expected to boost the local economy by creating employment and improving infrastructure as well as security.
The first phase of the development consists of two storeys with parking space for close to 1 800 cars, postal services, ATMs, a gym, several restaurants, an optometrist and beauty shops.

Phase two will include a hospital, a 4-star hotel with 200 beds, several sports retail shops and an office block.
Located near the Loftus Versfeld Stadium, a walking distance from the University of Pretoria and two high schools, the project benefited close to 35 architecture students who were able to learn by observing professionals during construction.
In addition, developer Abland would upgrade the road around the complex.

This includes improvements to traffic intersections; new traffic signals; an addition of lanes in Park and Kirkness streets to reduce traffic bottlenecks; and other traffic calming measures such as street lights and pavements.Abland marketing director Grant Silverman said the centre was also part of the Gautrain network with a bus stop adjacent to the precinct.
“Loftus Park sets a new standard for quality precincts in Pretoria, and seamlessly brings together business and leisure in one vibrant destination,” he said.
At the centre of the complex is a heritage building, the so-called “sin bin”, a clubhouse built for the local tennis club back in 1929.
The clubhouse has also been fully restored as part of the project.
