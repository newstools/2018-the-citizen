The horrifying weekend incident in which six people died near the KwaZulu-Natal town of Bulwer was a typical South African tragedy.
An alleged drunken driver ploughed his vehicle into a group of about a dozen pedestrians, killing five of them instantly and injuring others. People in the area who witnessed the crash then attacked the driver, stabbing him to death.
In one awful tableau, this country’s worst social traits – drunkenness and instantly ignitable anger – were on display.
Drunkenness in drivers and pedestrians was present in many of the fatal vehicle accidents over the long weekend, showing that the government’s campaigns to reduce drinking and driving are not bearing fruit.
While it is understandable that tempers would flare among those who witnessed the killings, it says a lot about us as a nation that those present had no hesitation in taking the law into their own hands … most South Africans do not have any faith in our system of criminal justice.
There has to be a change of heart and mindset in ordinary people. They must drink, if at all, in moderation. And they have to respect the rights of others, even those accused of crimes.
Sadly, however, we can’t see this happening any time soon.
