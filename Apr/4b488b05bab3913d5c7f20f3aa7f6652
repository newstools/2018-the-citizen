A hilarious clip of a young man praying at the door of a taxi prior to it setting off from the rank went viral on Wednesday because of the guy who interrupted the young Christian to sell airtime.
The guy pops his head into the train carriage to shout: “Vodacom! MTN!” repeatedly – to much laughter from those in the taxi – before taking his products elsewhere.
Extraordinarily, the prayerful young man just allows the vendor to do his thing before resuming the prayer and finishing it with an “Amen” –  as if nothing happened.
Some on Twitter joked that it was an ad break, while others said the devil was interrupting.
