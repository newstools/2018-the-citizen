Two of the 16 prisoners who escaped from the Johannesburg Correctional Services, also known as Sun City Prison, are from Kagiso, in Krugersdorp, and were awaiting trial on charges of rape, Krugersdorp News reports.

Chauke was expected to appear in the Johannesburg High Court on Monday, July 30, and Msezane on Monday, May 21, but they escaped with 14 others on Monday, April 9.
The inmates are suspected to have escaped through a pipe shaft before breaking through a wall in the Medium B section.
The escape is believed to have been an inside job, as many question the method in which the prisoners were able to get out of their cells in the first place.
The other prisoners were up on charges of murder, robbery and housebreaking.
Police have launched a manhunt for all the suspects since their escape.
Authorities urge friends, families and community members to contact their nearest police station if they spot any of the prisoners who escaped custody.
