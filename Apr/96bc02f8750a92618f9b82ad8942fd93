Interstate Bus Lines, which operates from Bloemfontein, said on Tuesday it had taken a decision to temporarily stop all bus operations on Wednesday due to the call for a national general strike by the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu).
In a statement, Inter State said one of the main Saftu events is planned for Bloemfontein and that due to safety considerations it was decided to suspend services on Wednesday.
George Mokgothu, CEO of Interstate Bus Lines, said: “The safety of our loyal commuters and employees remains our first priority, which is why this difficult decision was taken. We will, however, resume our operations on Thursday, as commuters in the greater Bloemfontein area has limited alternative transport options.”
The call for a Saftu strike comes amid a national strike by bus drivers that had caused chaos in cities across the country since late last week.
Government has urged stakeholders involved in the bus industry to speedily find a solution and resolve the wage negotiations impasse.
