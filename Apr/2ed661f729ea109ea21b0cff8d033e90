The Democratic Alliance’s plans, should they get into government after next year’s national elections, include doubling child support grants and scrapping the recent increase in Value-Added Tax (VAT).
The child support grant should be increased from R410 to R800, since the current grant does not allow for adequate nutrition.
DA leader Mmusi Maimane said yesterday it is “criminal that one in four children die every day thanks to malnutrition”.
He said the introduction of food vouchers are on the table, as well as cash transfers for food.
Maimane presented the DA’s policy resolutions ahead of its Federal Congress at the Tshwane Events Centre in Pretoria West.
The introduction of a jobseeker’s allowance, land reform, healthcare, employment, education, corruption and good governance are also on top of the list of more than 50 policy resolutions that the DA will deliberate on this weekend.
Head of policy Gwen Ngwenya said creating an SA that works requires them to get three things right: get South Africans into work; create an environment for work; and ensure nobody is left behind and out of work.
“Our priority is to get young people between the ages of 18 to 34 into employment,” Maimane said. “Delegates will debate the introduction of a jobseeker’s allowance to the value of R150 per month for all unemployed young people.”
Maimane said a Job Seekers’ Exemption Certificate, valid for two years, will be implemented to give people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more, the right to enter into any employment agreement with an employer on any conditions.
