Legal Eagle is quoted at 28-10 to win his second Premier’s Champions Challenge over 2000m at Turffontein on Saturday 5 May.
The Sean Tarry-trained runner won this race in 2016 but last year was pipped in a three-way tussle by Deo Juvente with Nother Russia a short head further back in third. Mike de Kock’s mare looks a massive threat again this year, especially as she took a while to get going over 1600m at the same course on Saturday when winning the Grade 1 HSH Princess Charlene Empress Club Stakes for the second successive year.
This race will, in all likelihood, will be her last race before going to stud so she will find a lot of support.
Abashiri ran a decent enough race in the Grade 2 Colorado King Stakes over this course and distance when a 2.25-length fifth behind Coral Fever. He has not won since completing his Triple Crown victory in the SA Derby on Classic Day in 2016 and his merit rating has fallen.
That will not help him much in this race as it is run at weight for age terms but the son of Go Deputy loves this course and is not without a chance.
Majestic Mambo has been nominated for both the Champions Challenge and the SA Derby and talk at Turffontein last Saturday was that trainer Paul Peter would prefer to go for the Champions Challenge.




However, that has still to be decided and all will be revealed on Thursday at the announcement of the final field.
Currently Majestic Mambo and Surcharge are joint favourites at 33-10 for the Derby over 2450m but it is possible that neither may run. Surcharge has also been nominated for the Daisy Guineas where he is perfectly drawn at No 3. It will also give him a chance to get a feel for Greyville ahead of the Daily News 2000 which could be in his sights.
Noble Secret and Like A Panther from the De Kock yard are both at 9-2 with Cash Time at 10-1 and Royal Crusade at 12-1.
The Computaform Sprint is always a thriller and Justin Snaith has entered speedy Sergeant Hardy for the R1-million Grade 1 race. He won the Grade 1 Cape Flying Championship over 1000m at Kenilworth in January and is likely to love the quick Turffontein course.


He had a good warm-up run in Durban recently in which he was just touched off by Hack Green in a Pinnacle Stakes over 1000m at Greyville.
As a result it comes as no surprise that he has been chalked up 3-1 favourite with Sean Tarry’s coupling of Trip To Heaven and Exquisite Touch at 11-2.
