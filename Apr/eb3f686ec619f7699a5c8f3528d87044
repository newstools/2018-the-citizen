Nigerian media reports that 162 babies and children have been rescued from three illegal orphanages – one of which is referred to as a “baby factory”.
The precise nature of the so-called baby factory is not clear as the term is sometimes used to describe children’s homes where abandoned or orphaned babies are sold for profit.
The BBC reported that in a previous case, the phrase has also described a place where pregnant women were reportedly held until they gave birth and their babies sold.
“To ensure protection for children we have shut three illegal orphanages homes. Of these, one operates as a baby factory while two others were unregistered homes,” said Lagos state Commisioner for Youths and Social Development Agboola Dabiri on Wednesday, referring to the 162 cases.
The children and teenagers rescued from the baby factory and homes have been placed at government-approved homes for care and protection.
