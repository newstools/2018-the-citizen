A Pretoria man who was thought to be missing from Saturday, April 21, has been found dead at the Steve Biko Academic hospital, Pretoria Rekord East reports.
The tracking device of Gerhard Rudolph’s car showed he had been driving in Hans Strydom Drive near Mamelodi at about 81km/h and went down to 0km/h almost immediately. But there were no signs of an accident.
The last coordinate was at a Mamelodi dumpsite, but a search yielded no joy for the family as the tracker was no longer active.
The car was later found on Solomon Mahlangu Drive looking like it had been involved in an accident. But he was missing.
A source close to the family said it was later learnt that his car had been involved in an accident in which all the occupants were fatally injured, and he was unaccounted for.
An extensive search ensued and several calls were made to mortuaries and hospitals throughout the weekend until he was found dead in the Steve Biko Academic hospital on Tuesday morning.
His father Gerhard Rudolph said following a weekend search, the family went to Mamelodi SAPS to inquire about an accident scene local officers may have attended to.
“That is how we learnt of his fate.”
Police spokesperson Captain Michael Mbewe said a culpable homicide investigation was under way.
