South African businessman Justin van Pletzen, who had an encounter with Ajay Gupta last Wednesday at an office block in Dubai, has been arrested by authorities in Dubai.
The department of international relations and cooperation (Dirco) spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya had earlier told Jacaranda FM the department was notified of Van Pletzen’s arrest.
On Wednesday afternoon they confirmed the arrest but are still unsure of why it happened or if it’s linked to the video. The date of his court appearance also still needs to be established.
“It is possible that he has been arrested for something else except confronting Mr Ajay Gupta,” he said.
Dirco said that they would maintain contact with Van Pletzen and his family to render consular services.
When Van Pletzen confronted Gupta, he had asked the fugitive when he would return to South Africa to answer to state capture allegations.
Gupta’s reply was that he would cooperate with law enforcement agencies once they “give him a reply”.
“They’re not giving a reply. The day they give a reply, I’ll go there,” Ajay said at the time.
Van Pletzen later said he was so incensed at the sight of Gupta that he wanted to hit him but was worried about what the authorities might do to him if he did.
Acting Hawks head Yolisa Matakata announced in February a warrant of arrest for Gupta had been issued related to corruption.
Mabaya told the radio station that South Africa’s ambassador to Dubai would pay a visit to Van Pletzen this morning and that from there, the exact reason for the businessman’s arrest would be determined.
He said on Tuesday afternoon there were a number of possible reasons why Van Pletzen had been arrested and that these may include him photographing areas he was not permitted to do so.
