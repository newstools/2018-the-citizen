There are reports of a dead body which was discovered few streets away from Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s Soweto home.
Police Minister Bheki Cele will brief the media on the latest developments in relation to the shooting that happened outside The Mandela Residence in Soweto last night.
The “suspects” firing gunshots around Madikizela-Mandela’s home turned out to be Umkhonto weSizwe military veterans (MKMVA).
According to the police minister, a firearm was discharged illegally, but MKMVA did it to honour their leader because firing such gunshots is part of a tradition when “an honoured person dies”.
It was initially reported that no one appeared to have been hurt, but the police are currently investigating.
