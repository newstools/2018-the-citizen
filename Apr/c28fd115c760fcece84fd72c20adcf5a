Politcal protest action should not derail North West province from reaching its potential, embattled premier Supra Mahumapelo said today.
 
In his Freedom Day message, Mahumapelo said communities must to continue to foster an agenda of rebranding, repositioning and renewal of the province.
 
He said the so-called RRR agenda was also intended at encouraging the provincial government to work together with communities in an effort to improve the quality of life.
 
“This Freedom Day, we urge North West communities to reflect on the economic development opportunities the Fifth Administration has implemented through amongst others, the VTSD [village, township and small dorpies] economic development initiatives, comprehensive agricultural support programme, the skills development programme, infrastructure development programmes in public schools, scholar transport services as well as the culture and arts programmes.
 
“This reflection is critical as it will afford us the opportunity to gauge our collective contribution towards realising our RRR agenda, while at the same time assisting us to identify areas that need to be prioritised for the attainment of the goal of building a prosperous society.”
 
North West celebrated Freedom Day following a fortnight of violent protests in which people have called on Mahumapelo, who faces corruption allegations, to resign as premier.
 
The protests started in Montshioa in Mahikeng on April 18 and have spilled over to other areas of the province, leaving a trial of looted shops and damaged properties.

North West police said over 400 people have been arrested since the protest flare-up.
