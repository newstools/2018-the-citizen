The Gupta brothers and their alleged acquaintance, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane, could face up to 30 years’ jail time or a fine of up to R100 million for each of the charges levelled against them.
The Sunday Times reports that the case, which would be the first state capture case to be prosecuted when it proceeds in a few weeks as expected, will revolve around the Vrede dairy farm project, in which R220 million was allegedly siphoned.
The Gupta brothers – Atul, Rajesh and Ajay – Zwane and other associates could face charges of money-laundering, assisting other to benefit unlawful activities and the acquisition and possession of proceeds of unlawful activities.
A source told the Sunday paper: “Once we have this in the bag we will go after everything else. We are working in phases. We will recover all the money stolen.”
The Guptas could find it impossible to escape to India, Britain and the United Arab Emirates after law enforcement in South Africa reportedly obtained cooperation agreements with the governments in those countries.
A police official quoted by the Sunday Times said the Guptas were “surrounded” and had “nowhere to go”.
Another source told City Press the arrests were a done deal and that arrest warrants had already been issued.
