People can say the most insensitive things with no regard whatsoever to how such remarks affect a person. Either said with good or bad intentions, we should know how to filter our words. Making uncalled for remarks on someone’s weight, height, skin tone or personal life is going a tad bit too far. We need to put boundaries and know which subject matter is open for comment or discussion. Some people are very sensitive and just a single comment badly articulated can cause a big problem. Let us not focus too much on other people’s lives, but live our own. What’s worse is that the people who say these insensitive comments often times are our friends, family members or colleagues. These are the people that should be supporting you instead of putting you down or demoralizing your efforts. We should be able to know how badly our words can affect someone. Do not be oblivious of your actions. Don’t be the kind of person that blurts out the first thing that comes to your mind. You need to have a “social filter” otherwise you will find yourself offending someone with each uttered word.
