One of the dominant themes in the series between the Proteas and India is an obvious one.
Even before the tour started, many fans were already licking their lips for the battle between AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli.
Both these dynamic batsmen have made their marks to date.
But who is the best between them?
Two famous captains – Graeme Smith and Sunil Gavaskar – weigh in on the debate.
GRAEME SMITH
It’s very difficult to decide between AB and Virat. AB probably has more shots. 
He started out a bit like Jacques Kallis early on, being very technically correct, but now he hangs back in his crease waiting for the bowlers to come to him. 
He’s the sort of guy who can get a hundred in 50 balls.
Virat is also always looking to take the bowlers on, mentally he loves a contest – you can see that in how many times he has got India over the line, he has an outstanding fourth-innings record. 
He seems able to plan exactly how he wants to take a bowler on and he can kill you clinically. 
They are both outstanding batsmen.
SUNIL GAVASKAR
AB just seems to have a bit more time and he is so composed, so for me he is just that little bit better.
Virat can get out to what a bowler has done, whereas you see in this series that AB has only got out because of something the pitch did. 
But there is enormous pressure on Virat and he is a brilliant player with great intensity and understanding of the game. 
He’s at another level to the rest of his team and makes batting look very simple. He is a great talent.
