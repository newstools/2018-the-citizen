Management of the South African Police Service has noted with concern, pictures doing the rounds on social media of what appears to be an armed robbery that is taking place at Bedfordview Centre.
Police followed up on the infornation and it has been confirmed in consultation with the Centre Management that there is no such robbery taking place as purported in the caption of the said pictures.
The Provincial Commissioner of police in Gauteng, Lieutenant General Deliwe de Lange, condemns the ill-considered, negligent sharing of inaccurate information on social media.
“In following up on information, law enforcement agencies deploy resources, energy and time unnecessarily, when other serious incidents of crime could in fact have been attended to. It is plain mischief and if found those responsible for such will be taken to task,” said the Provincial Commissioner.
