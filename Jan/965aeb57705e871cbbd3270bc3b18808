“Ms Chidi is currently investigating serious irregularities within Polokwane Local and Capricorn District Municipalities,” Smalle said in a statement.
Nothing was taken from her car and the perpetrators fled the scene after she refused to open her boot.
“The DA condemns this criminal act in the harshest terms and calls on law enforcement authorities to investigate all possible angles and leads. Ms Chidi has been instrumental in uncovering irregularities within Polokwane Local and Capricorn District Municipalities and has worked tirelessly to grow the DA in her wards,” Smalle said.
He went on further to say that the attack is “reflective of South Africa’s volatile political climate, which is marked by intolerance and in the most extreme of cases political killings”.
