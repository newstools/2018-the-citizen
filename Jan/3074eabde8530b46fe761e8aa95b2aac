Tennis legend Roger Federer keeps rolling back the years.
On Sunday the emotional 36-year-old broke down in tears after he won his 20th Grand Slam singles title with a 6-2, 6-7, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 victory over Croatia’s Marin Cilic to win the Australian Open for the sixth time in Melbourne.
The win equalled the record of six Australian Open men’s titles, held by Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson, and emulated Ken Rosewall’s feat of claiming three Grand Slam titles after the age of 35.
And the Swiss star says he is far from finished.
“Yeah, I’d love to come back. I hope I come back again next year,” he said. It’s a remarkable achievement for Federer, who successfully defended the title he won in Melbourne last year.
So many wrote him off after he went through a five-year Grand Slam title drought after winning the 2012 Wimbledon title.
However, he has now claimed three Grand Slam titles in the past 12 months and is hot on the heels of Spaniard Rafa Nadal in the quest to be No 1 in the world.
The Swiss puts down his success to a well-thought out playing schedule and an understanding wife and family. Federer fans will be hoping the fairy tale continues for years to come.
