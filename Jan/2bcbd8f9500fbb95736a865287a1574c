Travelling around in Eden Park after dark, one cannot help but notice how many streets are completely dark, Alberton Record reports.
In some streets, only one light is on and the residents report that it has been like that for months.
Abraham Street is one of the main streets with heavy traffic of vehicles and pedestrians who travel between Phola Park and Greenfield or locals from the community hall.The street is pitch black at night.
Jan Ferris, a resident of the street said the street lights have been off since December and sometimes only two lights are on but this would only last for a day or two.
Many complain about the never-ending construction work going on in the street which adds to the danger of walking in the dark.
Residents said the municipality must make a plan with these lights that aren’t working because it also encourages burglaries.
