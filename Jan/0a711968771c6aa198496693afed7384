Retail chain Clicks said on Monday its sales had risen by 14.2 percent in the 20 weeks to January 14, despite a tight consumer spending environment.
“Sales continue to be driven by our strong promotional offer, with the ‘3 for 2’ promotion on Christmas gifting again proving highly attractive,” chief executive David Kneale said.
“We are also encouraged by the incremental sales from our online store over the festive season.”
While the company did not anticipate any easing of the financial pressure on consumers, it was confident of its ability to trade through the challenging market conditions, Kneale added.
