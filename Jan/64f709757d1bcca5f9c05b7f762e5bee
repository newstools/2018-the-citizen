The allegations made by US researcher Viceroy that Capitec Bank takes significant impairments to its loans is incorrect, the bank’s CEO Gerrie Fourie said on Tuesday.
“They brought out a one-sided report which we believe a lot of things are factually, completely incorrect,” he said in a briefing in Cape Town.
Fourie said that Viceroy had not been in contact with the bank ahead of releasing its results.
Viceroy said its research showed that Capitec “is a loan shark with massively understated defaults masquerading as a community microfinance provider” and said the South African Reserve Bank and Minister of Finance should immediately place the bank into curatorship.
