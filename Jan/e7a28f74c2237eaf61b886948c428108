It was typical of Ladysmith Black Mambazo that after receiving their fifth Grammy award this week, they sent out a video on social media which had been filmed at their concert in California, belting out their hit song Hello My Baby.
It was a gift to their fans, offered in humble thanks to them and to the Grammy judges.
That’s the way the guys from the hills of KwaZulu-Natal roll … and the way they have been rolling since the release of their first album, an amazing 45 years ago. Group founder Joseph Shabalala has retired, but his reaction to the win was joyous.
He made the point that support for the group is also support for South Africa, emphasizing that, over the years, Ladysmith Black Mambazo has been one of our best exports – of any kind – and its members our finest ambassadors.
The thing that strikes one about this group – apart from their prodigious talent – is that they exude a love for life, coupled with a respectful humility which touches everyone they meet.
The rest of us might not have their singing ability, but we, as a country, can surely learn a lot from the way Ladysmith Black Mambazo live.
