While the emphasis of the workshop will be on capturing live performances, participants will also be trained in developing their own stories and conceptualising them in photographic projects in and around their communities.
The project will also assist participants in compiling and finalising a photography portfolio and provide information on how to enhance skills and topics of relevance for future careers.
Those interested in the project are invited and encouraged to attend an introductory meeting on Monday (January 22) at 10am at the centre.
Preference will be given to those living within the Ekurhuleni area.
