The two men, caught with their hands in the cookie jar when they were caught allegedly looting a house in Jackaroo Park, Mpumalanga, are out on bail, Witbank News reports.
The men appeared in Witbank Magistrates’ Court on Friday, January 19, and were granted R1 000 bail each. Their case was postponed to January 26.

The two men did not expect a fast-thinking homeowner, Martin Duncan, to lock them in the garage and call for backup so quickly.
Duncan said he purchased the vacant plot next to his own and met up with the estate agent and evaluator at 8am on Thursday, January 18.
“I met up with them at the plot and the keys were handed back to me. Everything was locked up and nothing out of place. I went back home for breakfast and my son from Johannesburg popped in. We went back to the vacant plot and that was when I noticed that the garage door was slightly open.”
When he heard a shuffling sound, he pulled the garage doors closed and called for help.
The two men then took a closer look and found that the backdoor of the house was broken open. A carpet was cut and put to one side. A borehole pump, some pipes and screens were also packed neatly. Other doors and locks were also broken or tampered with.
SA Community Crime Watch arrived on the scene shortly afterwards and the two men aged 26 years and 28 years were arrested.
“One of the young men told me they were looking for a plot to buy and that is why they were in the garage,” Duncan said.
Three cottages on his plot were broken into over December.
“I hope that this was the last break-in.”
