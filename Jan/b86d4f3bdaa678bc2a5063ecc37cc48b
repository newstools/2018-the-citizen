The 2018 Cape Town Cycle Tour will go ahead despite the deepening water crisis gripping the city, tour organisers announced on Monday.
At a press conference, tour organisers stressed that the iconic sporting event will go ahead on 11 March, with a range of interventions to minimise the impact on the city’s water resources.
Day Zero in Cape Town – when the taps formally run dry in homes – is now set for April 12.
