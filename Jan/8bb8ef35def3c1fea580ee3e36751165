Justin Snaith-trained Razed In Black, who comes off two bright runs on grass at Fairview, has a strong chance to post his ninth career win today when he teams up with champion apprentice Lyle Hewitson and takes on just four opponents on the Polytrack in Race 2, a Pinnacle Stakes over 1400m.
The six-year-old had Raymond Danielson aboard in his penultimate outing when carrying 61kg and snatching victory in a Pinnacle Stakes over 1600m. Aldo Domeyer had the ride next time when the gelding was a gallant short-head second in the 1600m CBC Memorial Mile (Listed).
The switch from grass to the Polytrack should not be a concern as six of his wins have come on the surface.
However, Razed In Black will have to be on guard against his stablemate Afrikaburn (Craig Zackey) who renews rivalry after having finished third, just a half-length behind him, in the Memorial Mile.
Next best are Tara Laing-trained Miracle Bureau (Callan Murray) and Alan Greeff-trained Our Icon (Greg Cheyne).
Greeff’s Albertina (Cheyne) looks the one to get punters away to a flyer in Race 1, a Maiden Plate (F&M) over 1200m. The three-year-old has been unplaced only twice in her seven starts on the Polytrack – the last of which was her most recent outing when she had Teaque Gould up and ran on strongly from a wide draw to finish a promising 0.35-length third out of 14 over 1200m.
Her main rivals are Stola, Mackerel Sky and U For Me.
The same combination could come to light with the filly Nicole who contests Race 3, a Maiden Plate over 1400m. This three-year-old has shown smart improvement with Cheyne up in her last three outings, following up on two thirds with an encouraging second from the worst draw over 1400m. She will be tough to beat this time with the advantage of pole position.
Making most appeal of the others are Dancing Ruga, Xanthus and Mahir.
