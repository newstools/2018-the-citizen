Los Angeles. Tom Hoge seized the third-round lead at the Sony Open on Saturday as US PGA Tour golfers shook off the panic caused by mistaken missile alert and got down to business in Hawaii. “For sure, to get that missile threat on your phone, you don’t know what’s going to happen,” Hoge said of the early morning scare, in which an alert was sent to cellphones warning of “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII”.(AFP)
