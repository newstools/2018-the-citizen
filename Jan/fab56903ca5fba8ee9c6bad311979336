Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters touched down on home soil this week, after travelling the world for two months. She was crowned Miss Universe in November last year, and is the second South African Miss Universe. Margaret Gardiner won the title in 1978.
The 22-year-old’s hectic schedule could, however, accommodate a short visit to her hometown of Sedgefield, where residents lined the streets and organised a parade in her honour.
As part of the parade, Knysna mayor Eleanore Bouw-Spies handed Nel-Peters the keys to the city.
Nel-Peters also visited Sedgefield to help a resident who was adversely affected by the fires that swept through the Garden Route in June last year.
She teamed up with various companies to help rebuild the resident’s home, small restaurant and two sheds belonging to the resident, who ran a self-sustainable farm and restaurant on the property.
The parade and assisting the resident proved successful, with countless residents, schoolchildren and companies attending the event.
Nel-Peters will after this visit be based in New York to fulfill her duties as Miss Universe.
Here is a photo of Nel-Peters at the parade:
