The police in Mecklenburg, Limpopo, are looking for a group of suspects who are responsible for the burning down of four houses at Ntsoaneng village near Burgersfort on Sunday afternoon during a ‘witch hunt’, Bosveld Review reports.
According to police brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, it is understood the incident comes after a group of residents accused of three local families of practicing witchcraft following the death of a young resident in December 2017.
