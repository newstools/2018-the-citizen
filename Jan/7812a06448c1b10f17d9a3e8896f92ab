The question of whether the Proteas might have an eye on this weekend’s Indian Premier League (IPL) auction during the third Test against India at the Wanderers is actually pretty silly.
It would be unrealistic to expect it not to be.
Given the massive payday on offer for some of the 41 South Africans up for grabs at the bidding, a player can’t plead ignorance.
After all, this is the way men like AB de Villiers, Faf du Plessis (R3.8 million reserve price), Quinton de Kock (R3.8 m), Hashim Amla, David Miller and Kagiso Rabada (all R2.9 m) make the type of money deserving of their super-stardom.
De Villiers, who was retained by the Bangalore Royal Challengers, will – for example – earn a staggering R21 million just this year.
At least skipper Du Plessis is honest about the sideshow intruding on their mission to secure a 3-0 whitewash over the touring Indians.
“We won’t have our phones with us, so we won’t immediately know what’s going on,” he said.
“There will be distractions in that regard. That’s normal and human. The IPL plays a big part in all of our lives.”
It’s perhaps a blessing in disguise then that the proceedings only take place on Saturday and Sunday, when the Test is supposed to have progressed to a reasonably advanced stage.
But Du Plessis and team management will still do their best to keep the priorities right.
“It’s important for us to keep the focus and energy for the Test,” he said.
“When we’ve reached the end of a day’s play, we can afford ourselves a bit of time to talk about the auction but when we’re back the next day, the attention needs to be fixed on the game again.”
