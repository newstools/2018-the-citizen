One swallow does not make a summer, but are we being hopelessly optimistic to see some signs of change in what has happened to Richard Mdluli?
He was the crime intelligence boss who is very close to President Jacob Zuma and was, shall we say, very useful to Number One during his term in office. Mdluli was on suspension for six years while the dithering justice system never resolved his case – that of assault and kidnapping in connection with the 1999 death of Oupa Ramogibe.
The fact that Mdluli has now been removed is tempered by the fact that, effectively, he went on his own terms, being allowed to take early termination, after having earned upwards of R8 million during his six years on suspension. However, the removal of people like Mdluli and others like him who have been defending and promoting Zuma bodes well for the future under new ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa. The fact that the removal of Mdluli was announced by Police Minister Fikile Mbablula, a one-time staunch Zuma man, may also indicate that some of Zuma’s friends have seen which way the political wind is blowing.
We hope many more of them realise the future is openness and honesty …
