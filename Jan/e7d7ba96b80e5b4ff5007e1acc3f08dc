“Apparently, the thousands of loose potatoes were deliberately and illegally dumped.”
He said officers were concerned about the people’s safety at that time of the night, and possible health risks associated with the dumped goods.
“The dumped potatoes showed no sign of being bad, but a health risk could be lurking as it is evident they would be cooked and consumed.”
