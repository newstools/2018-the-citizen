“The request by ‘All Tshwane Vat Alles employees’ received a thorough consideration which was followed by an approval – granted by the Tshwane metro police department [TMPD].”
The march is being organised by former contract employees in the extended public works programme, a government initiative to give temporary jobs to the unemployed.
Participants in the scheme in Tshwane have been dubbed Vat Alles workers.
Friday’s march was organised by former Vat Alles employees who demanded to be contracted again under the job programme. Their contracts expired last year.
Participants of the march were expected to gather at Burgers Park at 8am.
The marchers are to move from Burgers Park into Lilian Ngoyi Street then turn right on Madiba Street until they reach Tshwane House, the head office of the metro administration.
They will then proceed to the Union Buildings using Madiba Street and march back to Burgers Park using the following routes:

Leyds Street
Pretorius Street
Nelson Mandela Drive
Nana Sita Street
Thabo Sehume Street

Mgiba said the marchers were expected to disperse by 4pm.
She advised motorists to use alternative routes.
“Tshwane metro police officers will be deployed to monitor the march and affected streets. Unlawful activity will not be tolerated, and will be dealt with accordingly,” she said.
