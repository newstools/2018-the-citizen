Winnie Madikizela-Mandela seems to be recovering after being admitted to hospital due to a kidney infection.
The Mandela family previously released a statement saying she had been complaining about loss of appetite and pain in her legs. The veteran activist was hospitalised on Saturday.
The family’s lawyer, Pops Templeton Mageza, said Madikizela-Mandela was recovering from her infection and doing well. “I was with her last night and she is feeling much better.
The family is happy that she is recovering,” Mageza said, adding that he was not certain when she would be released from hospital but hoped it would be soon.
Madikizela-Mandela spent several weeks last year in hospital for her second back surgery because of a spinal stenosis and was later admitted for routine check-ups.
She was also admitted to hospital in 2017 for knee surgery and in 2016 and 2017 for diabetes, also undergoing a minor foot operation.
The ANC stalwart also had to undergo surgery in 2014 following another surgery in 2012 after falling and breaking her wrist.
Madikizela-Mandela was born in 1936 and married to ANC leader Nelson Mandela at the age of 22.
The couple divorced in 1996. She took part in the Women’s March of 1956, which was a protest against pass laws for African women during apartheid.
She was one of the activists who played a prominent role in the struggle of apartheid. Madikizela-Mandela is the country’s first black professional social welfare worker.
She is presently a member of the ANC’s national executive committee.
