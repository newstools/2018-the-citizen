The low water level at the Mnandi reservoir in Centurion, which is currently sitting at 13.5% capacity, has left Region 4 residents without water, Centurion Rekord reports.
Residents will now get water from a tanker supplied by the metro.

The water tanker will be stationed at 202 Lochner Road, Mnandi AH, in Centurion.
Residents in high-lying areas, who are mostly affected, will be supplied with water through the tanker city spokesperson, Lindela Mashigo said on Monday.
“The city had to shut down water supply from the reservoir in order to allow the reservoir to recover following the high water consumption in the area. Last week, the Tshwane metropolitan municipality pleaded with residents and the business community to be serious-minded about conserving water.”
Mashigo urged residents to use water sparingly.
“If this appeal is heeded, water-related interruptions will be minimised.”
Residents are reminded to apply the following hints to conserve water:

to continue to use grey water for watering gardens and flushing toilets,
to report water leaks and burst pipes,
to install water-saving devices,
where possible, install a low-flow showerhead and tap aerators,
use a dual-flush toilet cistern,
try to plant indigenous or drought-resistant shrubs in the garden,
water gardens before 08:00 or after 17:00 and only when necessary,
use a broom instead of a hosepipe when cleaning driveways or patios,
collect rainwater for re-use in the garden or for washing the car,
cover the swimming pool to reduce water evaporation,
take a shower rather than a bath,
close a running tap while brushing teeth or shaving,
regularly check toilets and taps for leaks.
