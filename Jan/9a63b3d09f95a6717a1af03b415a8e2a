Lungi Ngidi might’ve stolen the show on his Proteas Test debut in the second Test against India in Centurion but it wasn’t lost on him that he and Kagiso Rabada provided a massive piece of symbolism on Wednesday.
Not only were two young black quicks bowling for South Africa again in the pinnacle format of the game, they shared nine of the ten Indian wickets in the second innings.
“It did strike me when I was thrown the ball and I knew Kagiso was bowling at the other end,” Ngidi said on Wednesday following his Man-of-the-Match performance in the 135-run victory.
“I couldn’t really say anything during the game. It was more internal. But it really is a dream come true, I have dreamed about bowling in tandem with him.”
Indeed, Rabada has grow in his role as a senior bowler that Ngidi does look up to him despite only one year older.
“Just to make my Test debut with him at the other end is special. He actually has a lot of knowledge for a youngster,” said the 21-year-old Ngidi.
“He’s the No 1 bowler in the world and it shows. We had been chatting throughout the innings and sharing ideas. Just seeing some of them work out, shows how much he knows.”
But the awe Ngidi reserves for his teammate doesn’t mean he won’t chase him in the coming years for that world ranking.
“I wouldn’t want to give that objective a specific timeframe,” he said with a smile.
“As a sportsman, I’d like to achieve a milestone like that. I’ll definitely be chasing.”
Proteas skipper Faf du Plessis was ecstatic about his new pace weapon’s introduction to Tests.
“He bowled with such great control,” he said.
“It speak volumes of his maturity. When I looked at Lungi, I never sensed any nerves. He was really calm and just wanted to bowl. That’s a great sign going forward.”
