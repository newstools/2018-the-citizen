Dar es Salaam. Tanzanian swimming sensation Celina Itatiro will gauge her fitness in the ongoing junior national championships which ends today at the Haven of Peace Academy (Hopac), a Christian International School situated in Dar es Salaam. This comes ahead of the Commonwealth Games scheduled to take place in the Gold Coast city of Queensland in Australia slated for April this year. Celina – who easily meets the age category of the event – is the only swimmer who is in the national squad featuring in the championships. Other swimmers who form the Tanzania swimming squad ahead of the Commonwealth Games scheduled for the Carrara Stadium in Australia (April 4 to 15, 2018) are Sonia Tumiotto, Collins Saliboko and Hilal Hilal. According to Dar es Salaam Swimming Club (DSC) coach Michael Livingstone, Celina was in intensive training ahead of the event which features 182 swimmers from both Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. She also joined various swimmers to train in a special swimming camp which was under the DSC coach Livingstone and trainer Alex Mwaipasi of the Dar es Salaam-based competitive swimming club TALISS. “The aim of the swimming camp is for the swimmers to improve their skills and pace for the benefit of their country. We prepared a good training program for Celina that aimed to improve her skills and speed – and we believe she will make it,” Livingstone stated. Tanzania will be represented by 26 athletes and eight officials at the games. Apart from swimming, other sports are athletics, amateur boxing and table tennis. As it is, athletes with assorted disabilities have already been disqualified from featuring in the games after failing to meet the laid-down criteria. The athletes failed to feature even in a single international competition. They had been given until October 31 last year to feature in even one international game – and they failed to do so.
