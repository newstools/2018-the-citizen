The Dolphin Coast Taxi Association’s Chairperson, Dicky Govender, and his wife Saroj were shot dead along the R102 while they were travelling from Shakaskraal towards oThongathi in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), police said on Monday.
Acting KZN MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Weziwe Thusi, said initial reports indicate that an unknown vehicle sped up to the couple’s vehicle and opened fire while they were driving at the weekend. The driver lost control and went off the road, and came to a stop in a sugar cane plantation.
“We are very dismayed by the way in which the some people have lost respect and value for another person’s life in their zeal to kill and cause untold pain and suffering to family, relatives and friends of the victims,” Thusi said.
She said that the murder of Govender and his wife has all the traces of being premeditated, meaning the assailants were following them and knew where they would be. She said while the motive for the killing was not yet known, it should be strongly condemned.
“It follows the killing last year of the chairperson of the taxi association, Raymond Stephens. We further wish to appeal to all stakeholders in the industry to work towards finding amicable solutions to whatever points of conflict they may be confronted with.
“On behalf of government, I wish to send our deepest condolences to the Govender family in the time of grief, and urge the police to work with speed to apprehend the suspects,” Thusi added.
Police were still investigating the killings and have confirmed that the matter would be investigated by the Provincial Taxi Violence Task Team.
