Cardiac arrest vs. heart attack
Many get confused between the two. Medicinenet.com explains the difference: “A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, is damage to the heart muscle that occurs due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, depriving the heart muscle of the oxygen it needs to function properly. Cardiac arrest means that the heart stops beating and death is imminent.”
Experts explain that if severe, a heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest.
