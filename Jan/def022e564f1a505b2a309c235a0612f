“I wish to announce that Lt. Gen Richard Mdluli who held the position of Divisional Commissioner will be relieved from his duties. CI has seen 12 Acting Divisional Commissioners, this alarmed me greatly when I resumed my duties at the police. It’s now fixed,” Mbalula said on Twitter.
He said he instructed newly-appointed national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole to appoint a new divisional commissioner.
“I have instructed General Sitole to henceforth set out to appoint a fit and proper man or woman into the position without further delay. Again, I am saying we have no time to waste time.”
In 2011, Mdluli was suspended as head of crime intelligence but he has drawn his full salary and bonuses since then while the position had been filled only in an acting capacity.
Meanwhile, Mdluli and co-accused former policeman Mthembeni Mthunzi are facing charges of intimidation, kidnapping, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, and defeating the ends of justice for the 15-year-old case relating to the 1999 kidnapping and murder of Oupa Ramogibe.
Ramogibe allegedly received death threats after marrying Mdluli’s former girlfriend. He was warned to leave her or he would be killed. Ramogibe had reported the threats to the police before he was killed. A case of attempted murder had been opened by the police.
At the time, Mdluli was the station commander of the Vosloorus police station in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, and was accused of sabotaging the investigation. Mdluli denied the allegations.
In November 2012, an inquest into the killing of Ramogibe cleared Mdluli of any involvement in the murder.
The charges of kidnapping and assault relate to allegations that he intimidated and assaulted the family and friends of his ex-girlfriend to find out where she had moved to when she got married.
