Two pilots escaped injury when their light aircraft crash landed on Illovo Beach off Elizabeth Drive, south of Durban, on Saturday morning, paramedics said.
Rescue Care paramedics responded to the call just after 7am to “find that the plane was lying on its roof”, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said.
“The two occupants of the plane were found outside and had sustained no injuries in the crash. At this stage the events leading up to the plane crash are unknown. However, all necessary authorities were on the scene and will be investigating further,” he said.
