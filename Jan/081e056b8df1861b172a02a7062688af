Dar es Salaam. Former Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) General George Waitara, Seif Mcharo and Juma Likuli were the top scorers at the NMB Monthly tournament at TPDF Lugalo Club course over the weekend. Seif Mcharo, the national golf team player, won the Division A after netting one under par 71 strokes in the 18-hole tournament. He beat his closest challenger Shaaban Kibuna by three strokes. The latter returned two over par net 74 strokes. “The tournament was good, but the going was tough.

Also excelled over the weekend was Zabron Hamisi, who claimed the junior category title after returning 70 strokes. The runner up position went to Karim Ismail.
