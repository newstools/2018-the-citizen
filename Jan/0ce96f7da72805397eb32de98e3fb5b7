Ruan Klopper has reason to smile: within five minutes of his laptop computer being stolen from his house, it was back in his hands – thanks to the quick reaction of the local police station.
It is sad that we live in a country where such news is remarked upon and spread – but the reality is that our police force today generally has a very poor reputation. Granted, Klopper’s case occurred on a Sunday morning, which is a quiet time; and he lives in the small town of Ceres in the Western Cape (and small town people help each other out) … but it is a story which fills one with optimism and a bit of hope for the future.
It is a reminder, too, that despite the widespread corruption and inefficiency which plague the police in South Africa, there are many good cops – men and women who put their lives on the line every day, not for monetary reward (because the pay is not great) but because they believe they can serve their country and fellow citizens.
We salute those police officers and we thank them not only for what they do for us, but for the example they set for their colleagues.
