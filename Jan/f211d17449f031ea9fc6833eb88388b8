Anglo American Platinum said on Friday all conditions relating to the sale of its 85 percent interest in Union Mine and its 50.1 percent interest in MASA Chrome by its wholly owned subsidiary Rustenburg Platinum Mines to a subsidiary of Siyanda Resources had been completed.
“The effective date of completion will be 1 February 2018, when Siyanda will take over ownership, control and management of these operations,” it said in a statement.
The upfront disposal proceeds of R400 million would be received in the form of cash on 1 February 2018 and used to reduce net debt and further strengthen Anglo American Platinum’s balance sheet, the platinum producer added.
Under the deal, Siyanda will sell concentrate produced by Union Mine to Anglo American Platinum for a period of seven years, after which Anglo American Platinum will toll treat concentrate for the remaining life of Union Mine.
