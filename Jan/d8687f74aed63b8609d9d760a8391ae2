During skirmishes that broke out today during clashes between EFF and ANC supporters against the police at Afrikaans Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging, one woman found herself at the wrong place at the wrong time.
The police had their hands full dispersing the crowd with rubber bullets. In this graphic video, one injured protester can be seen being attended to by paramedics after being shot in the chest. It is not clear if he was still alive at the time.
As the paramedics attended to him while trying to keep the crowds away in order to do their job, they had to duck the bullets together with photographers on scene.
The video, courtesy of Eyewitness News, also shows one woman leaning against a black SUV in pain and asking reporters to check where else she had been shot.
“Le nthunyetsa eng hle bathong ba modimo nna ke itswela shopping [I am on way back from doing grocery why have I been shot]?”
