The chairperson of the Stellenbosch wing of the Democratic Alliance Students Organisation (DASO) Kerwin Jacobs has blasted his mother body for putting the breaks on a discussion on black consciousness that the Democratic Alliance Youth-Western Cape recently tried to arrange.
After trying to argue the necessity of the event to DA leadership in electronic correspondence, Jacobs took to social media to share his frustrations with DA leadership and their refusal to sanction the event.
In a portion of the email shown in Jacobs’ screenshot, the party lists a number of reasons why they would be against such an event.
“As the party we are operating in a very racially polarized environment where the opposition has nothing left to offer but playing the race card,” stated the party.

The unidentified DA representative in the correspondence goes on to state that advocating for the consciousness of one race is contradictory to the values and ideology of the party. This despite the DA showing support for the late Steve Biko and his ideologies over the years.














Biko was a known advocate for the concept and advancement of black consciousness and wrote about this at length.


In fact, one of Biko’s most popular quotes states that “black consciousness is an attitude of the mind and a way of life, the most positive call to emanate from the black world for a long time”.
The DA has not responded to our request for comment on this matter.
