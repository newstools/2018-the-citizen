Exotic bet players will be scratching their heads as they search for bankers at today’s Turffontein In-side track meeting.
It’s a challenging card, but glass-half-full punters will know a big pay-out beckons.
The obvious BiPot banker is Monopolize in the first leg, Race 2.
The three-year-old colt made a good debut for trainer Paul Peter 19 days ago, finishing second despite racing green.
With red-hot Gavin Lerena in the irons, Monopolize should trot up at 9-10.
Redberry Lane in Race 7, the last leg of the Pick 6, is a name that jumps out. The five-year-old mare was an underperformer for train-er Sean Tarry until she ran the race of her life to beat top-rated Snowdance in the Grade 1 Garden Province Stakes on July day.
That performance should make 7-10 chance Redberry Lane a gold-plated banker in this Assessment Plate. But she hasn’t run since that day and three promising three-year-olds – Elusive Butterfly, Running Brave and The Sash – are in the field.
However, with other Pick 6 legs looking ultra-competitive – Race 4 has five horses crammed in the 9-2 to 11-2 bracket – Redberry Lane is the banker gamble we must take.
