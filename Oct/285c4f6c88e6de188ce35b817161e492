Police have arrested two men following a cash-in-transit heist which claimed the life of a woman near Mthatha in the Eastern Cape.
National police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said the heist took place on the N2 on Monday evening.
He said: “During the heist, suspects who were travelling in a bakkie (light delivery vehicle), shot at the security vehicle bringing it to a halt. They then disarmed the three security guards, tied them up and forced open the safe, removing an undisclosed amount of money, as well as three firearms belonging to the security guards were taken.
“During the shooting, three vehicle’s that were passing at the time of the incident were hit by stray bullets. A 30-year-old woman was shot and killed and a man who was wounded was rushed to hospital.”
Naidoo said a team was then deployed to search for the suspects and two men, 25 and 29 years of age were arrested.
“The team initially found an abandoned vehicle in Maclear. Within hours thereafter, at approximately 9.30pm, they tracked down a vehicle with no number plates at a filling station in Mthatha. While searching the said vehicle, damaged money and [an] unlicensed CZ75 pistol were confiscated and the two men, believed to be linked to the said robbery, were arrested. Police are still searching for the remaining suspects,” he said.
Police commissioner General Khehla Sitole has condemned the killing and injuring of innocent people.
“It is extremely disturbing that innocent people are caught in the middle of such heinous crimes. As I convey my sincere condolences to the families of the woman and I wish the wounded man a speedy recovery, I want to assure the nation that we will do everything possible to track down all those responsible and ensure that they face the full brunt of the law,” he said.
