A joint intelligence-driven operation on Friday night has led to the arrest of eight suspects who feature on the police’s most wanted list.
According to a statement released by Captain Kay Makhubele, the arrests come as police, in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, have heightened visibility in and around Westbury, and intensified efforts to make sure the communities’ cries against drug dealings and gangsterism are acted on.
“Four of the eight suspects will face charges relating to the murder of 31-year old Bradley Saul who was killed in July 2018 after allegedly being accused of killing the son of one of the arrested suspects.
“The other four were arrested for possession and for dealing in drugs.”
A firearm and drugs, whose value is yet to be determined, were recovered during the operation.
Members of the public are encouraged to continue to report crime to police and to utilise the dedicated anti-drug hotline number 071 686 0190.
Alternatively, report crime to the SAPS Crime Stop number 08600 10111 or to any police station.
