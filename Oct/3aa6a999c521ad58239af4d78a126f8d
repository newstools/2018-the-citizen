Racing fans will be able to learn about the state of some of the three-year-olds in the Graham Beck Stakes and HSH Princess Charlene Starling Stakes.
Both are Grade 3 races over 1400m and carry a stake of R250,000.There looks to be a particularly fascinating duel in the Graham Beck Stakes where star performer Chimichuri Run from the Sean Tarry yard will take on Mike de Kock-trained Alyaasaat.
There are some other innovative races on the card, including the Monaco Million Maiden Sprint which carries R1-million in stake money.
One of the most interesting races comes up in Race 2, called the Hands N Heels Maiden Plate over 1400m.
It is a race in which the jockeys will not have whips and will need to find other ways and means to encourage their mounts.
