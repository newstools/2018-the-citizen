Socialite, singer and dancer Skolopad (Nonhlanhla Qwabe) blames two officers who were in her car when she had a car accident recently.
The sausage-wearing 35-year-old was on her way to the police station to be arrested when the accident happened last month.
She was instructed to drive to the Namahadi Mokodumela police station before her accident happened as she was reportedly spotted beating her daughter.
Two police officers saw her and instructed her to drive to the police station, according to the Daily Sun.
They got into her car. A male officer sat in the passenger seat while the female officer sat with her daughter in the back seat.
Skolopad claims when she went over a hump, the female police officer grabbed the steering wheel, which resulted in her colliding with an oncoming car.
The driver of the other vehicle died.
Her daughter sustained an injury to her left knee. Skolopad and one of the officers were taken to ICU after she broke her leg in the accident. She has been discharged from hospital.
A case of culpable homicide is being investigated.
This was Skolopad’s second stay in hospital this year. She was also rushed to hospital in July after overdosing on anti-anxiety pills.
