Ntsiki Mazwai has weighed in on the protests that ripped through Westbury over the last four days, saying that it was only a matter of time before something of this nature happened.
The Johannesburg neighbourhood has been the scene of violent unrest since Friday morning after a 45-year-old woman was shot and killed in a gunfight between three men on Thursday. Tensions in Westbury reached boiling point last night when the Rea Vaya bus station in the area was destroyed.
Mazwai took to Twitter saying that coloured people in South Africa were a ‘ticking time bomb’ because their collective voice is being silenced.


“It was just a matter of time. Coloured people in SA were always a ticking time bomb. A silenced voice. #WestburyProtest,” wrote the poet and musician.
She went on to say that authorities shouldn’t expect the protest action to end any time soon.




The protests in Westbury have stopped for the time being as Police Minister Bheki Cele has addressed the neighbourhood’s community this morning. The provincial police department has also agreed to investigate allegations of police corruption and address community concerns over rampant drug-related crimes in Westbury.
