A senior manager within Eskom, Molefi Nkhabu, has been placed on a precautionary suspension pending an internal investigation, News24 reports.
It was reported that the investigation is looking at internal audit investigation reports signed off by the senior manager which contain conclusions which may effectively absolve certain former executives implicated in maladministration.
The power utility reportedly announced the senior manager’s suspension on Thursday but did not provide details about the executives they may be absolved in the reports the manager signed off or when the probe into the senior manager would get underway.
Eskom was quoted as stating: “The Eskom executive management, whilst espousing the principle of the presumption of innocence, due to the seniority of Mr Nkhabu and the seriousness of the allegations made against him, took a decision that it would be better for him to be suspended until the investigation is finalised.
“The board and executive management of Eskom are keen and resolute in rooting out maladministration.”
