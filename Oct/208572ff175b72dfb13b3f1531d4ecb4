“The first call was received at 8.36pm and then the other accidents occurred soon after,” said Sec Pros Security’s Gerald Groenewald.
“All three were apparently the result of driving under the influence of alcohol.”

According to Groenewald, the accidents were at the intersections with Mooirivier Drive, Ysterhout Street, and Mooifontein Road.

Kobeli Mokheseng, an Ekurhuleni metro police spokesperson, said: “We responded to an accident at the corner of the P91 and Ysterhout Street where two motor vehicles were involved. There were no visible injuries.
“At 10pm, the police responded to a crash on the corner of the P91 and Mooifontein Road where two motor vehicles were involved. Both drivers sustained light injuries and were transported to Linmed and Tembisa hospitals for medical treatment.
The accidents occurred within 1km from each other.
Groenewald told Kempton Express that at two of the accidents, motorists tried to flee the scene.
“In the first incident, the driver of the one vehicle tried to flee but bumped into another vehicle.
“It was a similar situation with the second accident but metro police and our team gave chase and managed to stop the motorist from fleeing. The third accident was a head-on collision.”
No fatalities were reported in either of the three accidents.
