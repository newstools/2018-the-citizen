A woman whose identity is being withheld underwent a hysterectomy in July but soon realised something was terribly wrong. Her stomach swelled to such an extent that it looked like she was pregnant. The scar where the operation was performed turned red and bloody under the skin, reports Middelburg Observer.
When she went to look for help, she was shown the door at the Witbank Hospital, with the excuse that “their machines were not working”. Middelburg Hospital told her to come back in January 2019. However, her loved ones fear that in her current state, she may not live that long.

She has now been instructed to come back in three weeks, while the hospital tries to trace the doctor who performed the original operation.
The woman’s former employer, who has been supporting her financially, said: “The problem is that she lives with her family in Nebo at the moment and she has to travel very far to get to hospital and back. Because she is not working, she does not have any money and transport is expensive. She is also in a lot of pain, especially if she has to sit for long periods.”
