The postmortem will determine the cause of death.
Myburgh says apparently a man visited the suspect during the day.
‘The man forgot his cellphone in the suspect’s room. He went back later in the evening to get his cell phone. While looking for his cellphone in the room, he discovered the body of the boy under the mattress. The suspect ran away. He called the police and they attended to the scene,’ reported Myburgh.
