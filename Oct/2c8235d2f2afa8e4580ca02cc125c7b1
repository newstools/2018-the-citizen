The Islamic Relief SA organisation on Wednesday said it was assisting Indonesians who were affected by the devastating earthquake and tsunami that left thousands dead, many more hurt, and other survivors without shelter, food, and water.
The latest statistics published by the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management indicate that the death toll has now exceeded 2,000 while the number of injured has risen to 10,600.
Relief SA organisation CEO Yusuf Mohamed: “Despite government restrictions placed on foreign aid workers, our Indonesian office members have been on the ground in Palu delivering essential items such as food packs, water, gasoline and medical disposables.”
He said Islamic Relief’s disaster response team is on the ground in Palu, Sulawesi, assisting rescue operations following the earthquake and tsunami that hit the area two weeks ago.
“The people of Indonesia will take years to recover from this devastating emergency. While we are assisting with recovery efforts, it is heartbreaking to hear stories of villages being declared mass graves,” said Mohamed.
“Let us keep the victims and their families in our prayers and do all that we possibly can to assist survivors and the injured.”
