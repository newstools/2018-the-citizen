As from November 1, the city will no longer assist walk-in customers when it comes to drivers’ licences.
This is because they would like residents to use the new eNaTis online driver’s licence pre-booking service which was launched by MEC for roads and transport Ismail Vadi in August this year.
Those who would like to book a learner’s licence test, book a driver’s licence test, renew a driver’s licence card, and renew or apply for a professional driving permit (PrDP) will have to log on to the official site to do so.
The URL for the website is as follows: https://online.natis.gov.za/#/

The city said in a statement: “The National Traffic Information System (eNatis) of the department of transport, in partnership with the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), will help reduce long queues and shorten the time customers spend at licence stations.”
Walk-in customers for vehicle registrations, vehicle licence renewals, duplicate registration papers, scrapping of vehicles and change of vehicle ownership will still be accommodated.
