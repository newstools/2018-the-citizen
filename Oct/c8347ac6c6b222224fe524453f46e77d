Former Generations actor Mangaliso Ngema is facing a R8.3 million lawsuit filed against him by the National Empowerment Fund for a failed dairy farm project.
Ngema, alongside six other associates, was issued with court papers by the NEF this week after they failed to make payment for their debts, according to the Sowetan.
Ngema, who confirmed knowledge of the court application, has accused the NEF of running its affairs like a spaza shop.
He said: “They shut down our dairy farm operations after imposing consultants on us. Those consultants dumped us immediately [once] the money was finished and we were left with R6 million extra funding needed for the infrastructure. We are going to defend the application. Their claims against us are just malicious and untrue.”
NEF filed papers in the High Court in Johannesburg against Ngema’s company Business Venture Investments trading as Ntusi Dairy, owned by the Ngema family trust made up of Mangaliso, Robson, and Shaka Ngema, as well as the Kwangema Community Trust.
They claim Ngema terminated the business mentorship programme instituted by the fund to help his business.
