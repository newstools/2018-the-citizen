The DA’s Solly Msimanga will meet with community leaders of Westbury later today to hear their concerns around crime in the area.

The unrest began last Friday after a Westbury resident was shot dead and her niece was wounded in an alleged gang-related shooting.
Residents took to the streets in protest of the rising levels of crime in the area and they have since called on the provincial government to investigate the alleged complicity of police with those responsible for the ongoing violence.
The DA in a statement: “Today’s action by the community shows that they are fed up with the failing ANC government and that they are desperate for change, which restores order and keeps the people safe. JPMD has already increased the number of Metro Police Officers in the area to help fight crime, yet SAPSs visibility has not increased.”
The party went on to call for the area to be given an honest, professional, and well-resourced police service that is not corrupt, uncaring, and colluding with gangsters and drug dealers.
They have also echoed Westbury residents’ request for tactical response unit to assist with policing in the area.
