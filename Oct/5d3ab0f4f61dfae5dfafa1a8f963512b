South African jockey Grant van Niekerk is sitting joint seventh currently in the race for Hong Kong Champion Jockey with seven winners and well behind reigning champ Zac Purton but he does look likely to go close to winning Race 1 at Sha Tin today and his mount JIMSON THE FAMOUS (13) is sitting at a ractive Eachway odds of R8.30 a Win and R2.60 a place currently.
This is a good course and distance for JIMSON THE FAMOUS and is well enough drawn to be a danger.
Karis Teetan is proving to be the biggest threat to Purton’s reign and REBORN M (11) could go very close in Race 2.
