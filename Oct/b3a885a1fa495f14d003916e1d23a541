Sleeping passengers were robbed on board an South African (SAA) Airways flight headed for Hong Kong on Monday.
The passengers were allegedly robbed of cash and a watch as they slept on a flight from Johannesburg to Hong Kong.
The cabin crew were alerted of the missing valuables which were stored in the overhead compartments before they were stolen.
The items were later recovered by Hong Kong police who boarded the aircraft when it landed.
They searched some passengers and recovered some valuables.
SAA has confirmed the incident on flight SA 286 on Monday.


Spokesperson Tlali Tlali said a passenger pointed out a few passengers who had acted suspiciously, and opened the overhead compartments while others were sleeping.
Hong Kong police searched the suspects and nothing was found on them, but it was cleaning staff who recovered the watch on one of the seats in the same cabin.
The items were returned to their owners.
