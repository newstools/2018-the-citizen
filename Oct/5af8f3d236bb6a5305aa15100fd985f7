“The victims were leaving the centre when three suspects driving a white golf blocked the exit to one of the entrances,” said de Jager.
“Two suspects exited the golf and started banging on the windows of the victim’s car.”
De Jager said one of the car’s windows was broken open by the suspects.
While the robbery was taking place SBV Services was making a delivery at the centre.
