Judgment in the trial of self-confessed child-killer Mortimer Saunders has been set down for November.
The Western Cape High Court on Wednesday postponed the judgment to November 6. It has been set down for three days.
Saunders was arrested in May last year after the body of three-year-old Courtney Pieters was found in Epping Industria, nine days after she was reported missing.
He confessed to giving the child poison and assaulting her.
The state has urged the court to impose a harsh sentence and wants Saunders to be convicted of premeditated murder and rape.
Saunders denied raping the girl before she died but has admitted to necrophilia.
