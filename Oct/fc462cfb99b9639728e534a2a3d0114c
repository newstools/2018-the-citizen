The municipality has come under heavy criticism from opposition parties in recent months after Bidvest repossessed a fleet of its vehicles, which included ones belonging to the traffic, fire, water and sanitation and electricity departments.
In August, the municipality said the contract with the fleet provider had run its course and would not be renewed.
In the same month, power utility Eskom threatened to disconnect the municipality after it allegedly failed to honour its repayment plan.
Also in August, the DA alleged that the administration manager in Emfuleni did not have the required qualifications for the position.

It was also reported in the media that the municipality was paying its acting facilities manager more than R1 million per year, for a position he allegedly is not qualified for.
