On Friday, businessman and Sushi King Kenny Kunene shared a certificate of appreciation his foundation had received from the City of Joburg for his “generosity” following a fire in the Johannesburg CBD that claimed the lives of three firefighters.
While not revealing what exactly it was that Kunene’s foundation had contributed, the certificate said: “The City of Joburg’s Emergency Management Services wishes to extend its gratitude for the generosity shown by your organisation on the tragic day of the fire incident at the Bank of Lisbon building, until the burial of the three brave fire fighters who lost their lives.
“Your contribution has made a tremendous difference to the EMS department, and the City at large.”
Kunene tweeted a photograph of the certificate with a message that he felt humbled by the appreciation.


One of Kunene’s followers tweeted that the DA-run city was clearly not discriminating against him, despite his much-publicised clashes with the party’s leaders in the past.


As much as 60% of the buildings in the Johannesburg CBD are death traps and a tragedy waiting to happen, veteran firefighters warned last month.
It was reported that the Bank of Lisbon building, which also housed the Gauteng department of health, was just 21% compliant with safety requirements in the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
