Gold mining was found to be the biggest culprit when it comes to mine deaths as revealed by chairperson of the Mine Health and Safety Council (MHSC) David Msiza during day one of a two-day-long occupational health and safety summit hosted by the MHSC and the minister of mineral resources Gwede Mantashe.


A joined statement released by the summit’s hosts claims that the aim of the summit is for stakeholders to “collectively assess progress made in attaining the objective of ‘every mine worker returning from work unharmed every day: striving for zero harm’ and derive solutions that will assist the industry to improve the current situation”.
Mantashe says the government aims to help the sector get to a point where there are no fatalities on the job.
Statistics shared during the first day of the summit in Benoni, east of Johannesburg, show that although gold mining claimed the most lives through fatal accidents, deaths in the sector have decreased when compared to the same period in the previous year.




While delivering his maiden address at the summit, Mantashe made a number of demands of those in attendance in an effort to motivate them all to work towards their common goal.




Mantshe also alerted mine workers of their rights and insisted that there needs to be more education around that.


The minister spoke at length about the role that equipment and infrastructure play in OH&S and called for the prioritisation of rehabilitation of these things.


Delegates such as chairperson for the portfolio committee of mineral resources Sahlukile Luzipo, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, and Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel also spoke on the first day of the summit.
The summit will continue tomorrow at the Lakes Hotel in Benoni.
