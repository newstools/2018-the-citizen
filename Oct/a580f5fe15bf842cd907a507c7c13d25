Two people died in two separate attacks believed to be cases of mob justice in Olievenhoutbosch in Centurion, Pretoria, over the weekend, the SA Police Service said on Monday.
In the first incident, a man died and two others were injured when a mob, accusing the trio – aged between 22 and 35 – of terrorising the community at extension 37 in Olievenhoubosch, attacked them on Sunday.
Constable Tumisang Moloto said in a separate incident around 6pm the same day two armed men entered a tuck shop at extension 25, Jackals Street, and took an undisclosed amount of cash in a robbery.
“Allegations suggests that after the robbery two men were involved in a heated argument. However, in the process one suspect took out a firearm, shot and killed his accomplice,” said Moloto.
“The community members chased and apprehended the suspect and assaulted him with stones. He also succumbed to his injuries.”

Tshwane West Cluster Commander Major General Tommy Mthombeni condemned the attacks and he encouraged community members to report criminal activities at the nearest police station and to avoid taking the law into their own hands.
Three cases of murder and attempted murder have been opened at Olievenhoutboch for further investigation.
