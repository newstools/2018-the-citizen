Westbury community members have finally had one of their demands met, with Bheki Cele arriving at the Westbury stadium shortly after 12pm.


The community rejected attempts to have the address open in prayer, saying they want answers and a turn to talk.


Ten community members have since been given the opportunity to voice their concerns on the podium.
Residents are calling for Cele to deploy a task team in the area to eradicate drugs and gang-related violence that plagues the community.


About an hour ago, protesters were seen trying to negotiate the release of fellow protesters that were arrested. Instead, those arrested were seen being transported by police to JHB Central police station.
Protest action has been in full force since Friday after a woman was shot dead while caught in the crossfire of an alleged gang-related gun battle. This adds to the body count of victims who have died at the hands of gangsters and drug dealers in the area.


The community is complaining that they are marginalised and that they have been sold out by Patriotic Alliance president Gayton McKenzie to the ANC.
Since arriving in Westbury, Cele has committed to cleaning up corruption at police stations, especially in the Westbury area.


He also confirmed that since the shooting that claimed Heather Peterson’s life last week, two suspects have been arrested and two more arrests are expected. He also said that a tactical response team will be dispatched to patrol the area from today.
The drug allegations, however, would involve intense investigations, and Cele requested that 24 hours be given to investigate reports of drugs in the area.
