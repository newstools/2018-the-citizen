Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) is picketing at the department of correctional services head office in Pretoria demanding they produce proof to inhabit the Poyntons building.
Popcru is accusing the department of misinforming workers about the safety of the correctional services building by claiming it was safe to occupy.
The building was closed by Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga recently for failing to meet safety requirements.
Unions spokesperson Richard Mamabolo said they received expert confirmation that the building was still unsafe.
The Poyntons building in Pretoria CBD was closed for serious breaches of fire and emergency evacuation regulations two weeks ago.
Msimanga, after closing the down the building, said he was motivated by the three firefighters who died after struggling to douse a fire at a government building in Johannesburg.
He said the correctional services Poyntons building was shocking. Lights were faulty, with some of the lights sparking.
“If there were to be a fire, the building would go,” said the mayor.
Around 1,600 people used the building, which also accommodated members of the South African National Defense Force.
Department of correctional services officials were expected to return to work after the Poyntons building was given the green light to resume operations.
The department’s Logan Maistry said the prohibition order was lifted.
