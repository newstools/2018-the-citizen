A Facebook user by the name of Kevin Meyer has gone on a digital apology tour of sorts after he found himself in hot water for making light of the recent rape of a six-year-old girl by a 20-year-old man in the toilet at a Dros restaurant.
The alleged comedian posted a question asking moms how they discipline their young children before answering his own question by commenting “tell them if they dont behave ul send them to a Dros toilet” [sic].
The post was immediately screenshotted and shared numerous times drawing negative comments and inbox messages from social media users who were disgusted by what Kevin had to say.

After the furore began, Meyer tried to explain himself in the comments before deleting the original post and putting up two new posts. In one post, he promised to donate 20% of the profits from his next booking to charity before flippantly posting a status update saying “took stock of my life, found i had too few enemies, decided to change that” [sic].

Meyer’s posts since then have shown very little remorse for the content of his joke.

Social media users have called for Meyer to be “made famous” in the same fashion as those who are caught making racist comments or those who have been accused of rape, while others have insisted he be ignored as they believe he is merely looking for attention.
