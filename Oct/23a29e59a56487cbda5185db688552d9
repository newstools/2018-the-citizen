Singer and controversial Afrikaans activist Steve Hofmeyr has publicly refused to acknowledge the Eastern Cape Town of Makhanda and insists on referring to it by its colonial name, Grahamstown.


He went on to insist that he calls most towns by their old names and that this was not a sign of bitterness.


The name change has been months in the making but the decision to do so was officially announced on Tuesday. Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said the process of renaming the Eastern Cape town had “followed the letter of the law”.
“The town formerly known as ‘Grahamstown’ was named after Lieutenant Colonel John Graham whose role in the Frontier Wars was to exercise the ‘maximum degree of terror’ on the Xhosa natives and who was and is still infamous for his methods to ‘break the back of the native’ by employing the most savage means imaginable,” explained a statement released by the department on Tuesday.
