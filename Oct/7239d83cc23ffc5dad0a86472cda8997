One of two ANC officials named in the explosive report by advocate Terry Motau on the looting at VBS Mutual Bank says she feels bad.
Vhembe district municipality mayor and ANC Limpopo deputy chairperson Florence Radzilani  and provincial ANC treasurer Danny Masiza are implicated in The Great Bank Heist report commissioned by the SA Reserve Bank.
In a short video which has surfaced on social media the ANC deputy says she feels very bad as ordinary people of the Vhembe district have been affected.
“Obviously this is a matter which is also touching me, particularly because these are the people I’m serving.”
She said she planned to issue a response to Motau’s report in time.


The ANC’s top six met with the Limpopo officials on Monday to listen to their members side of the story.
The officials met at Luthuli House to unpack and understand the situation as it unfolded in the province. An ANC integrity committee is set to look into the report and those implicated in it in order to make a determination.
Masiza, reported to be the fixer in the VBS “heist”, is challenging the outcomes of the report. He is demanding a retraction of the allegations that he took part in the R2 billion graft.
He claims he was never given the opportunity to refute the claims.
He has been implicated as a “fixer” who had a role in ensuring municipalities made illegal deposits with the bank.
Fifty-three individuals including Msiza, Radzilani and Brian Shivambu have been implicated in the report. Shivambu is a brother of EFF deputy commander Floyd Shivambu.
