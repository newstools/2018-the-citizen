It has been a month since the Bank of Lisbon building caught alight and claimed the lives of three firefighters but the cause of the fire remains a mystery.
On Wednesday the Johannesburg Emergency services (EMS) said they were still investigating the cause of the fire at the 23-storey building.
EMS spokesperson Nana Radebe said: “The investigation is still continuing and we are waiting for some reports, once we have them we will release a statement.”
She did not say when the report would be complete.
