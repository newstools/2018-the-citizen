Chilean National Slavko Yaksic Besoaín, who has been missing since September 25, has been positively identified by his father at a mortuary in Ladysmith, reports IOL.
Yaksic, who also goes by the name Kako, was last seen in the Dundee area in KwaZulu-Natal. He departed Dundee and was on his way to Bergville, but was not been seen since. He was due to return to Chile on October 10, and when he didn’t arrive, his family became worried, prompting his father Sergio to fly to South Africa to find his son. A nationwide search was also launched for him.
He had been in the country since August with his girlfriend, who returned home while Slavko continued to backpack through KZN.
