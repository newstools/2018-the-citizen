Former Hot 91.9 FM breakfast show host Sasha Martinengo has doubled down on the allegedly racist comment that got him fired from the radio station earlier today.
Hot 91.9 FM’s managing director, Lloyd Madurai, released a statement around midday announcing that the station had “elected to remove Martinengo from all involvement with the radio station with immediate effect,” after the DJ referred to Julius Malema as a “monkey” live on air.
“This morning an unfortunate and completely unacceptable incident took place during the Breakfast Show whereby, during the course of the broadcast, a reference was made by anchor presenter, Sasha Martinengo, who said ‘[A]nd people still listen to this monkey,’ referring to Mr. Julius Malema,” the statement read, and went on to issue an apology to Malema.
Martinengo has taken to Twitter to say that he stands by the comments he made earlier in the day.
“I’m sorry if I offended anyone, but I stand by what I said,” Martinengo  tweeted. “Anyone, irrespective of their race, colour, creed, religion, gender who disrespects a woman is a monkey.”


Martinengo’s comments have set off a Twitter blaze that is currently raging on the social media platform. As one would expect there are very few tweeps who are impressed with his comments.








However, there are just as many who are leaping to his defence.
