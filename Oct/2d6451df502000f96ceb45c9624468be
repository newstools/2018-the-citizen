The Department of Correctional Service (DCS) is appalled by a video of a “plastered” officer found sleeping on duty with a misplaced firearm.
A video of the officer surfaced on Wednesday showing the DCS officer sleeping behind his jacket while on the job. An official who is believed to be his senior wakes up the officer, only to find the officer intoxicated.
The officer refers to the official as “Meneer” and tells him that he is fine. When asked if he was fit for duty, the officer is adamant he is fine.
The official then relieves the officer, only to notice the officer’s firearm is missing.
“Where is the firearm, where is the firearm, hayibo hayibo….” the official shouts.
The officer continues to say the firearm was there, pointing to the table as he searches.
The department confirmed they were aware of the video and were investigating. In a statement, the department said they were appalled and aggrieved by the video.
“A service delivery charter clearly defines what is expected of a correctional official and how one ought to behave in the line of duty. The mandate of the department of correctional services is to contribute towards a just, peaceful, and safer South Africa, and that demands that our officials must maintain a sound state of mind and be professional in performing their duties.
“This matter will be fully investigated and the department condemns this type of behaviour in the strongest possible terms.”
