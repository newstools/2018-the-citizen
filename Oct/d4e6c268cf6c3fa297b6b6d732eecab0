The recently announced Western Cape premier candidate for the Democratic Alliance (DA) Alan Winde has vowed to continue to put pressure on the national government to hand over the authority of Metrorail to municipalities in the Western Cape so that they can effectively manage the daily operation of the region’s trains.
According to Winde, Minister of Transport Blade Nzimande refuses to acknowledge that there is a crisis with Metrorail.
“While he is turning a blind eye, commuters are struggling to live, learn, and work,” stated Winde in a statement.
The DA believes that the proper working of the Western Cape’s trains is crucial to the people in the province and needs urgent attention.

They went on to add that this has become even more of a priority as the country will undergo yet another fuel hike at midnight tonight.
“It is a death blow to the pockets of many people across our country. This hike is yet another way that the failing ANC-led national government is keeping people away from economic opportunities,” stated Winde.
The party went on to blame what they have dubbed “the failing ANC’s mismanagement” adding that “through cadre deployment and corruption, the ANC has squandered money meant for empowerment and development”.
