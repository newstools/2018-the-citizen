At least one worker has died in the explosion at the Free State power plant this afternoon, while another worker has been seriously injured.
Eskom is still investigating the “major incident that took place at Unit 5” of the Lethabo power station, the power utility said in a statement.
It has apparently been waiting for a large dust cloud to clear to enable a more thorough search for workers.
“We can confirm that there are injuries but cannot confirm further details at this stage. Management’s first priority is to ensure the safety of all staff on site. More information to follow as details become clearer,” Eskom said.
Meanwhile, an Eskom customer network centre or depot in Orange Farm, Gauteng, was evacuated earlier today following damage to the building and vehicles caused by angry protesters who were against the audits being done on electrical installations and the removal of illegal connections.
Eskom has experienced similar protests in other parts of Gauteng, with the most recent incidents happening in Diepsloot, Protea Glen, Katlehong, and Winterveldt.
The Orange Farm area has been experiencing power outages in recent months due to overloading of transformers, which usually explode due to pressure from illegal connections.
