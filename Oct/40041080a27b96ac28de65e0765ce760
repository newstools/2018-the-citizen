Though up in class, Stephanie Miller-trained Netherby Hall looks the one to beat at Flamingo Park today when teamed up with Ryan Munger again in Race 4 and top event, a Pinnacle Stakes over 2200m.
Partnered by Munger, this five-time winner has held form well in four outings this season at the venue where he was a gallant second in the 2200m Diamond Stayers and then a bold runner-up under 60kg over 1800m.
Munger had to forgo the ride next time when unable to make the weight of 50.5kg and the gelding was a well-beaten fourth in a 1800m Pinnacle Stakes.
However, reunited with Munger in his fol-lowing outing the seven-year-old ran out a decisive winner under 57.5kg over 2200m.
Then in the gelding’s subsequent outing when up in class with Munger aboard, he ran on stoutly to fi nish a promising second over 1800m. Carrying 52kg again he could go one better this time over the extra distance.
However, expect a bold bid from 60kg top-weight Seattle Sunset (Francois Herholdt) out of Cliffie Miller’s stable.
This nine-time winner has yet to win over the distance, but there was much to like about the seven-year-old’s last run as he ran on stoutly under 58.5kg to score by an increasing four lengths in a 1800m Pinnacle contest.
With a similar good draw he deserves the utmost respect.Also in with claims is Tienie Prinsloo’s seven-time winner Quid Rides (Wayne Agrella) who returns a er a stint in Port Elizabeth where he was a gutsy winner over 2200m at the Fairview Poly-track.
Then over the same distance he was a creditable second and third, but can be excused for being unplaced next time when sent off favourite over 1900m as he had a bad start.
