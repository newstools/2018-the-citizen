A group of Hillbrow residents gathered this morning to take on suspected drug dealers in the area. They later started burning tyres and chanting in protest.
The situation quickly got out of hand and according to Times Live, residents pelted police with bottles and rocks when they tried to clear several roads.


According to EWN, the police then responded by firing rubber bullets to disperse the crowd.


The police later confirmed this with the publication before adding that the crowd has since regrouped.


Officers who were at the scene reportedly told Times Live that they heard protestors say the action was linked to the Gauteng Shutdown which was inspired by the Westbury protests and later moved to Ennerdale and Eldorado Park this past week.
