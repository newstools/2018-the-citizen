“Suddenly everything was dark, and the next moment this thing came rushing towards us,” Tutuwedzo Lodge and Conference Centre owner Stef Joubert told Kormorant.
Stef and about 40 guests, including overseas visitors, were all on the deck of the lodge when the mini-tornado surprised them.

Stef said: “We were just coming back from a safari trip and guests were enjoying drinks and snacks when the sky suddenly got dark. We decided to leave the deck in case a storm was about to hit. Some people got back in their vehicles and were on the way to the lodge when this ‘thing’ hit us. We just saw how the roof swayed, trees breaking and the water tank being ripped out. It was very scary. The roof of our neighbours’ store was also ripped off.”
