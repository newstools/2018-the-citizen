Trippi’s Express doesn’t fit the usual profile of a five star bet.
This colt only won his maiden two weeks ago, and while it was as easy a win as you will see this year, if truth be told he beat a well below average bunch.
But Brett Crawford’s inmate has an aura of real quality about him, as first seen when he was a clear second to subsequent Listed winner Pleasedtomeetyou on debut.
He wasn’t heavily punished by the handicapper a er winning, with a mark of 85, and isn’t being tried at an unrealistic level in Race 4, at Durbanville today, a MR 73 Handicap over 1250m.
Corne Orff er’s mount is worth a decent bet, and can be bankered in all exotics.
Fellow youngster Captain-o hesea appears best of the rest. Another to make strong appeal is Mumtaz in Race 2, a fillies and mares Maiden Plate over 1000m, but for rather different reasons. Richard Fourie’s ride hasn’t appeared anything above the ordinary in her three runs, but faces an extremely thin bunch of maidens form-wise, and if unable to win here may need to move to a weaker centre.
The only form threat is Winter Five, who fi nished only a length off our selection last time out three months ago.
But she has seven runs behind her, and Mumtaz has greater scope for improvement, as well as current race fitness on her side.
She should be able to get the job done, and these two should have the race to themselves.
Race 3 is a FM 72 Handicap, also over 1000m, where Star Angel should provide some value in an open contest.
This Joey Ramsden-trained filly caught the eye making late progress last time, and should be right there in the finish once again at what should be a competitive price.
