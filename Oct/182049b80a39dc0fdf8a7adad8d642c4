The conduct of a correctional services officer, depicted drunk while in uniform in a video circulating on social media has appalled the department, an official said on Wednesday.
“The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) is aware of a video depicting a drunk official in DCS uniform circulating on social media. The department is deeply appalled and aggrieved by this video,” spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said.
“A conduct of this nature can never be allowed in DCS, hence an urgent investigation has been instituted.”
In the video, the visibly inebriated official is awoken, seemingly by a superior at DCS, and struggles to converse and to stand still. When asked where his service firearm is, the man checks his holster sees it is missing checks on the chair where he was sleeping and even searches his pockets. He is also unable to stand on one leg when asked to do so.
Nxumalo said the official’s bad conduct was in contravention of the service delivery charter.
“The service delivery charter clearly defines what is expected of a correctional official, and how one ought to behave in the line of duty,” said Nxumalo.
“The mandate of the Department of Correctional Services is to contribute towards a just, peaceful and safer South Africa, and that demands that our officials must maintain a sound state of mind and be professional in performing their duties.
“This matter will be fully investigated and the department condemns this type of behaviour in the strongest possible terms.”
