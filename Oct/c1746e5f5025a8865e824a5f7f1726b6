The two male suspects, aged 33 and 42, have been linked to four previous cases of drug dealing, and also featured on the police’s list of wanted suspects. The third suspect is a 41-year-old female.
Drugs confiscated include CAT and crystal meth, whose value is yet to be determined.
Police management in Gauteng has welcomed the arrest of the trio as police continue to collaborate with communities in cleaning up the streets of Gauteng from drugs and other crimes.
The public is encouraged to continue to report crime to police and to utilise the dedicated anti-drug hotline number 071 686 0190. Alternatively, report crime to the SAPS Crime Stop number 08600 10111 or to any police station.
