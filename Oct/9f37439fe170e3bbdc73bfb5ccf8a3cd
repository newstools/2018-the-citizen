FeesMustFall activist Mcebo Dlamini says he is considering leading the ANC Youth League after being approached by several branch members.
The 31-year-old, facing charges of public violence, theft, assault and violating a court order related to fees must fall protests in 2016 at Wits University, said he was responding to the demand for him to lead the ANC Youth League (ANCYL).
He reportedly said it was time to relaunch an ANCYL that would focus on and deal with youth issues.
Several branches countrywide have, according to Dlamini, approached him to contest the president position, which is already being eyed by KwaZulu-Natal secretary-general Thanduxolo Sabelo and the league’s treasurer, Reggie Nkabinde.
With the ANCYL elective conference expected to be held between October 18 and 21 in Johannesburg, Dlamini may be in the driver’s seat by November.
He told The Sowetan that several people had asked him to lead and he was considering it.
The Eastern Cape’s Amathole region has expressed its view that Dlamini is the perfect candidate to revive the league. Representative Bandile Mdlagaso said Dlamini did not just theorise issues. This was seconded by Mpumalanga eMalahleni ward 22’s Simphiwe Shugube, who said Dlamini was relevant on the ground compared to his counterparts.
A third nod came from Sello Maebele from ward 73 in Hammanskraal, who said Mcebo understood the problems faced by the youth and was the person who could deal with the issues.
Dlamini’s next court appearance will be on October 19.
