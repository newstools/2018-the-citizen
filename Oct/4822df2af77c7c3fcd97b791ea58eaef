Was it a stray bullet or was somebody taking aim at one of the top civil servants in the office of the premier? These are some of the questions being asked following the discovery of a rifle cartridge at the premier’s offices in Langalibalele Street on Tuesday morning, reports Ladysmith Gazette.
Pietermaritzburg Central Police Captain Khosi Khonjelwayo, said police can confirm a cartridge was found on the premises.
“No one was injured. The matter was reported by the office’s employee and is being investigated,” said Khonjelwayo.

It is believed that an employee from the director-general’s office, upon reporting for duty on Tuesday morning, discovered the stray bullet that had been shot through the office window of the province’s Director-General Nonhlanhla Mkhize.
A police source confirmed that no one was on duty at the time in the building.
“Police investigations are at an advanced stage and this is being taken seriously considering the recent spate of political killings in the region. We are also not ruling out the possibility that this could be taxi-related, as the area’s busiest taxi rank is situated directly across this building,” said the source.
