A mother and her two children reported missing at Amandawe in KwaZulu-Natal last month returned home earlier this week but her five-year-old daughter was knocked over by a vehicle after running into oncoming traffic.
Captain Nqobile Gwala said 28-year-old Thandeka Msomi, her deceased daughter Minenhle and two-year-old son Lindani had been seen walking along the Mpambinyoni river bridge on September 1 but never returned home.
He continued: “Enquiries with friends and relatives yielded no success. It is believed that she had been chatting with someone in Johannesburg on social media and had arranged to meet him at the Park railway station on Wednesday, however, she never arrived.
“The mother has safely returned home on Tuesday 02 October 2018, after going to Palm Ridge in Johannesburg to visit a family member. It is alleged that the cellphone she had was stolen at the bus rank in Durban and was therefore unable to notify anyone of her travel plans. While getting off the taxi at Amandawe, her five-year-old child ran into oncoming traffic and was knocked down. She later succumbed to her injuries. A culpable homicide docket has been opened for investigation.”
