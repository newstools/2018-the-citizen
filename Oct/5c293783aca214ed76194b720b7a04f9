With a sharp eye for detail, Bilal Asif carefully labours over his quest for a pointedly unusual world record – crafting the largest swing ever made from pencils.

“Some people criticise my work but I don’t react to them,” he said.
He likes to point out that the swing is not just about breaking records, drawing a line between his art and his quest to promote friendship abroad.
“This is not only a world record but this is a message of peace from the whole Pakistan to the other countries through this art,” Asif adds. “This is my aim.
