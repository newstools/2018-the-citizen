The five-bedroom mansion in which former president Jacob Zuma allegedly raped Fezekile “Khwezi” Ntsukela Khuzwayo in 2005 is up for sale for R6.5 million.
The home, which is located in the affluent, tree-lined suburb of Forest Town, also has five bathrooms, four entertainment areas and a koppie in the garden.
Sunday Times reports that Zuma’s spokesperson confirmed that the house was up for sale but could not disclose any more information as the property was not a state home.
The publication also states that the home was bought for R3.6 million for Zuma by Hola Recruitment & Selection Services in 2005. The company is allegedly owned by Zephroma Sizani Dubazana who once worked as Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma’s personal assistant while Zuma was deputy president.
Firzt Realty is handling the sale and a consultant told the publication the house could be viewed by appointment.
