Pieterse said police and the fire department started searching for the two people on Sunday.
“The river was still too strong after the rain and we could not find anything,” he said.
“It is unlikely that we will be able to find anything when the river is this strong.”
Pieterse said the search would continue on Monday.
He added, however, they could not confirm there were indeed two people that drowned in the river.
“It is only speculation and no missing reports have been filed,” he said.
