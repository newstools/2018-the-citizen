Three people were arrested during a protest today in Ventersdorp, North West police said.
Captain Sam Tselanyane said the trio were arrested for public violence.
Community leader Sello Dassie said the protest would not stop until government delivers the N14 development project promised to them in 2006. The N14 project supposed to consist of a shopping complex, townhouses, tourism attraction hub and agricultural hub, amongst others.
Protesters blocked the R53 linking Klerksdorp and Ventersdorp using burning tyres. The R30 between Rustenburg and Ventersdorp was also barricaded.
The entrance to Tshing was also blocked with rocks scattered at the front.
After the police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters, they regrouped at a nearby sports ground, where they contemplated their next move.
“We will never rest until the N14 project is delivered,” said Dassie.
