Weekend fighting between rival ethnic groups in western Ethiopia killed at least 44 people, state affiliated media reported Tuesday.
The clashes occurred on the border between the central Oromia and western Benishangul-Gumuz regions.
Violence began when officials from Benishangul-Gumuz were killed by unidentified gunmen, said the Walta Media and Communication Corporate, citing the region’s communications chief Zelalem Jaleta.
The clashes between youths from rival ethnic groups armed with rocks and knives forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes with security forces deployed to pacify the area.
Benishangul-Gumuz is one of Ethiopia’s nine regional states, stretching to the border with Sudan.

At least 58 people were killed in September when fighting broke out in the capital, with those fleeing saying they were targeted by Oromo mobs because they are members of minority ethnic groups.
Fighting between the Oromo – the country’s largest ethnic group – and the Gedeo minority in the south of the country meanwhile has displaced nearly one million people.
