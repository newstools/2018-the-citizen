Journalist Niren Tolsi, awarded the Ruth First Fellowship earlier this year, gave the annual Ruth First Lecture at the University of Witwatersrand on Thursday evening.
The multi-award winning freelance journalist gave a talk called Fire and Media: Towards a new South African journalism.
The talk addressed the way South African publications cover fires, beginning by looking at the Knysna Fire but going on to use fire as a metaphor for journalism in South Africa as a whole.
The way three black children who died in the fire was reported on is juxtaposed with the reporting, in much greater detail, on a white family who had succumbed to the same fate.
The speech moves on to question the current state of South African journalism, which he says has become “toxic” – looking at social media, outrage culture, click-bait, and the “digitisation and atomisation” of media.

“There was, once, an optimism that technology was wholly good for journalism. But we have learnt, through pro-Gupta online trolls, paid-Twitter, fake news sites, the emergence of social media influencers, and Russian social bots that we cannot trust social media,” Tolsi warns.
“The numbers — of followers and interactions — used to grade our online relevance and success were untruths. Journalism had not checked its facts when unquestioningly embracing technology.
“We are now one-dimensional in our knowledge and information gathering.”
It also looks at the way journalism, in the past and present, “colluded with power” – calling the history of apartheid-era South African journalism an “undistinguished history for which South African journalism has never properly atoned”.
