The payment of the full amount will enable Khato Civils to carry out its mandated task of completing the bulk supply of water to 55 villages in Giyani.

“The department regrets the delay in the payment and hopes that now that the full funds have been released the service provider will be able to complete its mandated task within a reasonable time frame,” said Deborah Mochotlhi, DWS acting director-general.
“The beneficiaries who will benefit from this project remain our primary focus as the department. We will ensure that the project is completed timeously so that access to water is fully realized in all the 55 villages in Giyani,” said Mochotlhi.
