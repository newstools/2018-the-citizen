In a statement on Tuesday, the SAPS confirmed that the two men allegedly responsible for killing two security guards last week in Soweto were shot and killed by police during the early hours of the morning.
Members from the Gauteng Organised Crime Unit, acting on intelligence and supported by various other police units, were led to a shack in the Clermont area, West of Durban, said Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo.
“When police tried to arrest the two suspects, Lindokuhle Cebekhulu (24) and Mbuyiselo Mthonti (26) they resisted, which resulted in both suspects being shot dead. There are no reports of any police officers being injured at this stage.
On 10 October the two security guards had been murdered while seated in their patrol vehicle in the Moroka area before their firearms were taken from them. This incident was captured on a video that went viral, sparking widespread condemnation.
Naidoo said Crime Intelligence and the Gauteng Organised Crime Unit had worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to track down the culprits.
“A handgun, which was recovered at the scene, will be sent for ballistic testing to establish if it was the weapon used in the killing of the guards as well as if it was used in the commission of any other crimes.”
