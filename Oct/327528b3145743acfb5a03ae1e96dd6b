Livestock theft is on the rise around AbaQulusi, KwaZulu-Natal, and the SAPS is urging community members with livestock to be extra vigilant.
The issue of stock theft was among the main crime issues that were raised at the meeting between Neighbourhood Watch and the SAPS last week.
In a very recent incident, a school teacher was released on bail of R2,500 after having been caught stealing cattle with two accomplices near the Sasko area, Vryheid Herald reports.

The three are said to have been loading the cattle onto a trailer that was being pulled by Vryheid school teacher Thamsanqa Mncube’s bakkie.
The trio apparently tried to run when they saw a police vehicle approaching, but Mncube failed to outrun the police.
Mncube’s case was postponed to October 29 and the other two are still at large.
Community members who have stock theft matters to report can contact 034 989 6800.
