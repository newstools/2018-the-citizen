As National Senior Certificate (matric) school examinations kick off on Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged families, communities, and the country to support the 796,542 pupils writing them.
Ramaphosa said in a message: “Our nation is proud that you have reached this important milestone in your life. Your success in obtaining the National Senior Certificate will unlock new possibilities in your own life and for our country.
“Your best defence against the stresses that naturally accompany examinations is to give yourself the best chance possible through adequate preparation. Discipline today means success tomorrow.”
Ramaphosa praised the department of basic education and teachers for preparing the students over the course of 12 years.
Around 37,340 candidates were due to take the first practical examination in Computer Applications Technology on Monday.
The matric examinations will be undertaken at 6,888 centres countrywide until November 28.
On Monday, South Africa’s governing African National Congress also sent out well wishes to the Class of 2018.
ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe said: “This assessment is a culmination of many years of hard work and dedication by the [pupils], educators, and administrators alike and we wish them the best of luck during this important time.”
