Following in the footsteps of Tshwane’s licensing centre, the City of Ekurhuleni will no longer accommodate walk-in customers looking to book driver’s or learner’s licences, reports Kempton Express.
This follows the launch of the new eNatis online driver’s licence pre-booking service by Ismail Vadi, the MEC for Roads and Transport, in August.

This applies to the following services:
· Booking a learner’s licence test;
· Booking a driver’s licence test;
· Renewing a driver’s licence card; and
· Renewing or applying for a professional driving permit (PDP).

To apply for the above, bookings must be made at online.natis.gov.za.
The new system will help reduce long queues and shorten the time customers spend at licensing stations.
Walk-in customers for the following would still be accommodated:
· Vehicle registrations
· Vehicle licence renewals
· Duplicate registration papers
· Scrapping of vehicles
· Change of vehicle ownership
