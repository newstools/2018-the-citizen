Former ANC North West chairperson and North West premier Supra Mahumapelo has joined a court application to set aside the ANC national executive committee (NEC) decision that disbanded the provincial executive committee (PEC) on August 31.


Mahumapelo’s troubles began as he was forced out as North West premier for what DA provincial leader Joe McGluwa called “mismanagement and callous leadership” which later sparked a wave of violent protest in the province calling for Mahumapelo to step down.
He was later fired as ANC chair in the province together with the entire leadership and the ANC subsequently formed a provincial task team (PTT) to take over from the disbanded leadership.
Mahumapelo was initially part of the PTT but he later quit.
Earlier today, ANC branches from the North West made their way to the South Gauteng high court to challenge the decision to disband the PEC as they insist the move was unlawful.
Mahumapelo, represented by advocate Dali Mpofu, joined the action.


The branch members later protested outside Luthuli House calling for Mahumapelo’s reinstatement.
