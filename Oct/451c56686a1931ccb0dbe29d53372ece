The accident is believed to have occurred in the early hours of Sunday morning and has left police officers baffled at what could have caused the driver to lose control and almost submerge his entire vehicle in the crocodile-infested river.


Police indicated they must still obtain a statement from the driver as he had been rushed to hospital from the scene.
It is unclear if there were any passengers in the vehicle.
