“The suspect entered the deceased’s bedroom through the window, attacked and strangled her to death. He was immediately arrested at the scene and was positively linked to the incident,” Ngoepe added.
The deceased was identified as Rebeccah Chuene Ramadimetja.
Ngoepe says the motive behind the incident is still unknown at this stage, but domestic violence cannot be ruled out. A murder case has been opened and police investigations continue.
The 36-year-old suspect will appear before the Thabamoopo Magistrates Court soon.
“We are urging people to refrain from resorting to violence, especially against the elderly, when resolving domestic disputes. They should instead consult with their local authorities for intervention. Elderly care is still a serious concern to us and communities are advised to ensure the safety of our senior citizens at all times to prevent these types of incidents from happening,” concluded Ngoepe.
